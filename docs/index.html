<P>Jot is a collection of a few basic text editing functions wrapped up in a terse programming language with a customizable user interface and highly capable viewer. The default startup script sets up a useful selection of functions and reasonably-sane function-key environment.</P>

<P>Anyway, you might well ask, why should we be needing yet another text editor when there are already dozens to chose from? Well one good reason is that this one is better than the others, being simpler, speedier, smaller, more powerful, more flexible, less crashey and much more fun than many of it's main rivals.</P>

<P>In comparison to the three main open-source rivals: emacs, vim and nano. Not only does jot match the power, sophistication and elegance of emacs without requiring postgraduate degrees in pure and applied emacs but it also matches the simplicity and can-do usefulness of vim without the usual RSI risks. But what, I hear someone ask, about nano? Well, if anyone's still bothered about the sizes of executable in this day and age, the jot executable is significantly smaller than nano's. More importantly, jot is nothing like as crashy as nano.</P>

<P>The default startup script defines a powerful although generalist set of functions. When it is necessary to go off piste, command strings can be typed in without entering any special mode. The jot language consists of about 40 terse commands and a similar number of more specialised ones for housekeeping operations. Then it's just programming - a skill many text-editor users claim to possess anyway.</P>

<P>Jot came about in response to a requirement to analyze large intermediate CAD files, reports and source files. For these it's frequently necessary to cross-reference two or more files (maybe a violation report, a netlist and a parasitics file) to extract some nugget of truth, locate an inconsistency or identify elements mentioned in some report. That kind of activity demands a programming interface and very speedy, reliable text processing.</P>

<P>Although it's natural environment is chewing it's way through large CAD files, that power, speed and adaptability make it extremely useful for many other text-based applications. It's quite useful for documentation maintenance, it can generate simple htmls can interface with a spelling checker to generate reasonably tidy plaintext documents. It interfaces well with virtually any kind of command-driven agents - document-format converters, spelling checkers, compilers, debuggers, CAD systems ...</P>
