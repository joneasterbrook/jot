Why, you might well ask, should we be needing yet another text editor when
there are already far more than one could shake a stick at.

Jot was developed specifically for analysis of CAD files.
Generally the requirement is to cross-reference two or more files and 
extract some nugget of information, locate an inconsistency or identify 
elements mentioned in some report.

Machine-generated plaintext CAD files can be *very* large.
The capacity of jot is pretty good but insufficient for the largest 
of these - jot has an optional filtering feature that can be 
used to extract the elements required to answer your question.

Although it's natural home is large CAD files, jot is equally 
useful for extracting information and generating reports and 
summaries from any kind text files. With the correct agents 
it can process text from PDFs MS-word docs and spreadsheets.


- Powerful (ECCE-like) command language.
- Recovery of a session following a crash.
- Strong interaction with system environment - can interface with helper apps
e.g. spelling checkers, text <=> binary converters - in particular
spreadsheet, wordprocessor and pdf files.
- Good support for large files, especially those with abnormally long lines.
- Tidy handling and display of tabular text especially spreadsheets.
- A useful library of command scripts.
- Easy construction of macro-commands and hot-key mapping.
- Supports unicode.
- Minimal use of magic modes and similar trickery.
- Hash-table support - allows indexing and speedy lookup in large files.
- Good support for abnormally wide text.
- Has a handy document-processing facility - formats paragraphs, maintains
headings, interfaces to external spell-check agent.
- Useful debugging environment.
- Very well behaved i.e. hardly ever crashes or locks up.
- High capacity - OK for CAD files etc, can pre-filter oversize files.
- Text can be colour tagged in the display.
