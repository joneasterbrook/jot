1 JOT User Guide
----------------
  This is a guide aimed at those who just want to  find  out  how  to  use  an
  editor that works. A more detailed technical guide  can  be  found  at  `jot
  technical guide` or, for real-life examples, there's `jot walkthrough`.
 
1.1 Description of the Editor
-----------------------------
  Jot is a command-driven text editor  with  a  modern  viewer  and  a  simple
  concise language.

1.2 Backstory
-------------
  The jot editor owes much to the Edinburgh Compatible Context Editor  (ECCE).
  ECCE was designed back in the days of teletypwriters and consequently has  a
  somewhat old-fashioned look and feel compared to editors designed for modern
  video terminals.
   
  What ECCE does have is a  terse,  easy  and,  above  all,  powerful  command
  language. This language forms the basis of jot - see the  `Jot  Programming`
  section for details.

1.3 What is a text editor and why should I want one?
----------------------------------------------------
  Modern computers have a filing system holding a great many  files.  Many  of
  these files are binaries - meaningful to the computer  but  incomprehensible
  gobbledygook to you and me but many files are  plain  text.  Some  of  these
  files  are  primary   setup   files,   written   by   someone   others   are
  computer-generated log-files and some are intermediate data files written by
  the computer and intended to be  read  by  the  computer.  This  is  because
  someone has decided that, although it would have been easier to  write  this
  information in some sort of binary code, it would help if  we  humans  could
  also read them and try to make sense of them and diagnose problems.  
  
  A text editor is an essential tool wherever there is  a  need  to  study  or
  change these text files.
  
  Many windows users will have encountered notepad - this  an  editor  with  a
  simple command structure that can search for a  substring,  substitute  some
  other substring, to do a global search & replace and, er, that's  about  it.
  Often we have an enormous file with thousands of  simple  substring  matches
  but only a minority match some more detailed context specification. To  find
  instances of real interest,  we've  either  got  to  manually  wade  through
  thousands  of  potential  matches  or  switch  to  an  editor  with   better
  context-matching.
  
  A common feature of all modern editors is that they display text in a window
  on the computer screen with a cursor showing the current  focus.  They  also
  obey simple instructions to alter the text and to change the  focus  in  the
  text - typically with the cursor-control keys (Up, Down Left, Right, Page Up
  and Page Down). They can search  the  text  for  specified  combinations  of
  characters (strings), insert new text strings, erase and substitute strings.
  The better editors can do all this and much more.

1.4 Starting jot
----------------
  jot  is  normally  started  by  entering  a  suitable  command  to   a   CLI
  (Command-Line Interpreter -  either  a  unix  shell  or  a  windows  Console
  (formerly known as an MS-DOS prompt window).
  
$ jot <pathName>
  
  The standard startup script (`startup.jot`)  will  set  up  a  viewing  area
  covering the entire screen except for the last two lines.
    - the lowest line on the screen is the console area - see `About  the  jot
      console and display windows`About the jot console and display windows 
    - above that line is a delimiter line which displays the pathname  of  the
      file and a single-character buffer key, initially you will find yourself
      in buffer ( . ).
  
  There are several `command-line qualifiers`. Should you type in an incorrect
  pathname, or no pathname at all, the editor will start but jot will set  the
  pathname to:
    [ Nonexistent file: <givenPathName> ]
  If, what you actually wanted to do was to start typing in a  new  file  then
  the -new qualifier will avoid this.
  
  Equally important are the commands for exiting jot:
    - %A (Abandon) - exits the editor without writing the file.
    - %C (Continue) - writes the file and exits.

1.5 About the current character and substrings
----------------------------------------------
  The editor places a special marker, the cursor, in the text to indicate it's
  current focus. This is the point where text might be inserted or  the  start
  point for searches.
  
  On completion of a successful find, verify, substitution or  insertion  (see
  `F`, `V`, `S` and `I` commands). The relevant substring  is  highlighted  on
  the screen  and,  internally,  some  special  pointers  are  set  up).  Some
  subsequent  substitute  command  can  then  replace  the  currently-selected
  substring with some new  substring  -  see  also  `%U`.  Also  the  selected
  substring can be set by the `ou` stack operation.
  
  Any command that involves moving the current character pointer  will  remove
  this highlighting and reset the internal pointers.
  
  The current-character cursor is displayed  in  reverse  video.  This  cursor
  reflects the state of internal current-record and current-character pointer.
  This is allowed to go one character position past the end of  the  line.  At
  this point there is no character to highlight. When this happens, a tilde  (
  ~ ) is displayed at the end of lines to indicate this situation. 
  
  Some may wonder why the cursor is allowed to go past the  end  of  the  real
  text. Well fear not, it's all been thought about. By allowing the cursor  to
  go past the line end, jot avoids  the  necessity  for  special  flavours  of
  commands operating at and after the current character. Eg. jot has only  one
  insert command ( `I` )  which  inserts  before  the  current  character  and
  there's no need for a magic mode or another  command  to  insert  after  the
  current character.
  
  When a substring has been selected (e.g. by a find  command)  the  substring
  and the substring is displayed with underscores with the  current  character
  in reverse video. Of the commands which define a substring, some  leave  the
  cursor at the start of the substring (e.g. find - see `F`) others  leave  it
  at the end. For these  commands  the  current  character  is  the  character
  immediately following the substring (e.g. traverse `T` and insert `I`).
  
  In tty mode (see `-tty`) The current line is printed and below it the  carat
  character ( ^ ) indicates the current character, and tildes ( ~  )  indicate
  the currently-selected substring.

1.6 About words, lines, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, sections and chapters
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Most text files are structured in some way.  Many  are  written  in  natural
  languages  structured  in  words,  lines,  phrases,  sentences,  paragraphs,
  sections and paragraphs. Machine-readable text and machine-generated reports
  are similarly structured but into  more  formal  units  e.g.  code-sections,
  modules and expressions. 
  
  The jot startup script defines  several  functions  that  operate  on  words
  presented in the context of phrases,  sentences,  paragraphs  and  chapters.
  These functions can search a large document to find  instances  of  phrases,
  sentences etc. containing a required selection of words. These functions are
  designed  for  natural  languages  are  still  useful  in  the  context   of
  machine-readable source files or machine-generated reports.
  
  Hopefully everyone understands the concept of words, phrases, sentences  etc
  in the context of natural languages. For the benefit of the  scientific  and
  engineering community, the definition of a  word  has  been  stretched  from
  simple strings  of  alphabetical  characters,  meaningful  in  some  natural
  language; to include also digits and underscore ( _ ) characters.
  
  A phrase is taken to be any number of words, extending over  any  number  of
  lines bounded by either:
    - a blank line,
    - any ASCII punctuation character - a comma ( , ), a semicolon (  ;  ),  a
      colon ( : ), or a full stop ( . ).
  Note that these functions will require adaptation for languages  using  some
  other punctuation characters in the unicode space.
          
  A sentence is taken to be any number of words, extending over any number  of
  lines terminated by a full stop followed by whitespace (". "). Sentences are
  currently defined to begin with an upper-case ASCII alpha character ( A-Z ).
  While, strictly, a sentence may be  terminated  with  other  marks  queries,
  plings, colons and semicolons, for most purposes the definition used here is
  adequate.
  
  A paragraph is any number of words, spanning any number of lines bounded  by
  either blank lines, a discontinuity in  indentation  level  or  the  top  or
  bottom of the buffer - see `ParagraphUp`,  `ParagraphDown`,  `FindParaNext`,
  `FindParaPrev` and `spellCheckParagraph`.
  
  A headed section may include any number of paragraphs,  and  is  bounded  by
  section headings or the ends of the text buffer. Section  headings  are  not
  indented and must have any digit in  the  first  character  position  -  see
  `HeadedSectionUp`,    `HeadedSectionDown`,    `FindHeadedSectionNext`    and
  `FindHeadedSectionPrev`.
  
  A section is any number of paragraphs bounded  by  either  a  chapter  or  a
  section heading - see `SectionUp` and `SectionDown`.
  
  A chapter may include any number of sections and paragraphs, and is  bounded
  by a chapter headings or the ends of the text buffer. Chapter  headings  are
  not indented and must have any alphabetical character in the first character
  position    -    see    `ChapterUp`,    `ChapterDown`,    `FindChapterNext`,
  `FindChapterPrev` and `spellCheckChapter`.
  
  A block is any number of lines, paragraphs, sections or chapters, bounded by
  either a completely blank line or the top or bottom of the buffer. The blank
  line must must not even contain blanks or tabs - see `BlockUp`, `BlockDown`,
  `FindBlockNext` and `FindBlockPrev`. 
  
  The point of blocks is they allow another level of grouping  of  text  above
  paragraphs. When a sequence of paragraphs are to be grouped  into  a  block,
  the empty lines separating them are  replaced  by  a  line  containing  some
  blanks (ASCII 0x20 ). This works  particularly  well  with  machine-readable
  text where, in the interests of readability, the code contains blank  lines,
  yet it would be convenient for the  editor  to  recognize  the  higher-level
  grouping.
  
  Where the function has to identify  words  from  other  characters  such  as
  punctuation marks or operators separating identifiers in an  expression,  it
  uses the `Q` command. for most purposes it defines a word to be a string  of
  the following character classes separated by some other ASCII characters:
    - any ASCII numeric character (0-to-9),
    - any ASCII upper or lower -case alpha (A-Z and a-z),
    - an ASCII underscore ( _ ),
    - any unicode character in the range 0x0100 to 0X20039 - this will require
      some refinement by those knowledgeable in  these  languages  since  that
      range includes some  local  currency  symbols  and  special  punctuation
      characters for languages using these alphabets.
      
   The following functions have been defined specifically for navigating these
   syntactic entities:
    - `WordLeft`, `WordRight`, `WordUp`, `WordDown`,
    - `DeleteWordLeft`, `DeleteWordRight`, `RestoreWordLeft`, `RestoreWordRight`,
    - `SelectionWord`, `SelectionLine`,
    - `SpellcheckWord`,
    - `DeleteLineLeft`, `DeleteLineRight`, `RestoreLineLeft`, `RestoreLineRight`,
    - `LineLeft`, `LineRight`,
    - `ParagraphUp`, `ParagraphDown`,
    - `HeadedSectionUp`, `HeadedsectionDown`,
    - `BlockUp`, `BlockDown`,
    - `ChapterUp`, `ChapterDown`,
    - `SectionUp`, `SectionDown`(matches either chapter or section headings),
    - `SentenceUp`, `SentenceDown`,
    - `FindPhraseNext`, `FindPhrasePrev`,
    - `FindSentenceNext`, `FindSentencePrev`,
    - `FindParaNext`, `FindParaPrev`,
    - `FindHeadedSectionNext`, `FindHeadedSectionPrev`,
    - `FindChapterNext`, `FindChapterPrev`,
    - `FindBlockNext`,  `FindBlockPrev`,
    - `FindInNLines`, `FindInNLinesPrev`
    - `ReformatParagraph`
    - `MakeParagraphIntoBullet`
    - `SpellcheckParagraph`
    
  The  {Word|Paragraph|Chapter}{Left|Right|Up|Down}   functions   are   simple
  navigation functions and do pretty-much what it says on the tin.
  
  The {Delete|Restore}Word{Left|Right} functions move  words  and  part  words
  between the current buffer and the delete-bin buffer ( % ).
    
  The `ReformatParagraph`, `MakeParagraphIntoBullet` and `SpellcheckParagraph`
  are dedicated to document preparation - see `text document preparation`.
  
  If  your  system  has  aspell  installed  (see  `installation`)   then   the
  SpellcheckParagraph function will pass  a  copy  of  the  current  paragraph
  through Aspell and will display the results..

1.7 Navigation by context
-------------------------
  There are several options available for searching or navigation by  context.
  This is an essential element in any text editor - in response to some search
  specification, the editor changes focus to some place  matching  the  search
  specification in some way.
    - The primitive find command `F`,
    - the regular-expression find command `%F`,
    - The basic `FindNext`, `FindPrev` functions.
    - The basic `SubsThenFindNx` and  `SubsThenFindPv`  substitute  then  find
      again functions.
    - the  `FindSequence`  function  -  locates  a  sequence   of   substrings
      irrespective of separating punctuation and whitespace,
    - `PopupSearch` and `PopupIncrementalSearch` - these  display  results  in
      the popup menu - see `the popup-menu functions`
    - `FindWild` and `FindWildPrev` 
    - `FindSequence` and `FindSequencePrev` 
    - the `FindLineOrd` function -  finds  a  line  containing  the  specified
      substrings in the order specified,
    - the `FindLineUn` function  -  finds  a  line  containing  the  specified
      substrings in any order and
    - `the context-proximity functions` (see below) these take  formal  search
      specification involving several  substrings  and  locate  matching  text
      units.
    - `the vertical-search functions` - these  search  for  a  string  written
      vertically in a column of text.

1.8 The context-proximity functions
-----------------------------------
  Quite often we're looking for a sentence, phrase,  paragraph,  or  whatever,
  about a specific issue which can only be reliably  identified  by  searching
  for specific combinations of words.
  
  In addition to the usual global find functions, jot offers several functions
  designed to locate combinations of words and substrings within  one  of  the
  syntactic units  described  in  `about  words,  lines,  phrases,  sentences,
  paragraphs, sections and chapters`
  
  There are several options available for navigating by context-proximity:
    - `FindParaNext`, `FindParaPrev`,
    - `FindPhraseNext`, `FindPhrasePrev`,
    - `FindSentenceNext`, `FindSentencePrev`,
    - `FindHeadedSectionNext`, `FindHeadedSectionPrev`,
    - `FindChapterNext`, `FindChapterPrev`,
    - `FindBlockNext`,  `FindBlockPrev`,
    - `FindInNLines`, `FindInNLinesPrev`
  These functions take a search specification and, starting from  the  current
  character position, locate the next appropriate syntactic unit matching  the
  specification.
  
  A search specification consists of a series of elements:
    - a simple string that must appear in the matching unit,
    - an exact word that must appear in the matching unit -  i.e.  the  string
      must be bounded by non-alpha characters,
    - a sublist of simple strings or exact words, of which at least  one  must
      appear in a matching unit
    - an inversion of the normal logic so that  a  matching  unit  must  *not*
      match to an element.
      
  These  functions  Find{Phrase|Sentence|Paragraph|Chapter}{Prev|Next}  search
  through your document finding a specified selection of substrings within the
  specified syntactic unit - either a Chapter,  a  paragraph,  a  sentence,  a
  phrase, a sequence on n consecutive lines or a single line.  The  substrings
  may appear in any order and can be specified to be either complete words  or
  fragments of words as required. Where a word has  valid  alternatives  these
  may also be specified.
  
  The FindInNLines and FindInNLinesPrev  functions  are  similar  except  that
  these ignore natural-language syntactic units. Instead, for these functions,
  all matches must be within an n-line search aperture.
  
  On completion, the forwards-searching functions leave the cursor at the  end
  of the syntactic unit, the backwards-searching ones leave the cursor at  the
  begining. This behaviour facilitates repeated searches. The  find  functions
  mark the syntactic-unit boundaries by highlighting the nearest non-null line
  with a red background. Inside the syntactic unit,  the  first  instances  of
  each matching string is highlighted in green.  Note  that,  for  the  longer
  units (e.g. chapters) the string-matching highlights may not be visible  and
  that there may be more valid matches which have not appear in highlights.
  
  A valid find specification consists of a whitespace-separated  list  of  any
  number of elements, each element can be one of:
    - A simple string that must appear in any matching text unit,
    - A simple string prefixed by a hashmark ( # ) - in this case  the  string
      specifies a complete word (any string of alphanumeric characters bounded
      by either whitespace, a non-alphanumeric character or the end of line.
    - A series of strings separated by vertical bars ( | ) - in this case  any
      string in the list is a valid match. Any members  of  this  sublist  may
      also be prefixed with a hashmark to indicate an exact match to a word is
      required. The vertical bars may be surrounded by any  number  of  blanks
      which are ignored.
    - An exclamation mark, ( ! ), also known as pling or bang, may  appear  at
      the start of a search-specification element - in this case the  matching
      text unit must *not* match the following specification.
    - Any number of blanks are allowed to appear in the search strings  -  but
      each must be escaped by prefixing with a backslash ( \ ).
  
  The find functions take a find-specification argument in  the  form  of  any
  number of these elements in a whitespace-separated list.  This  argument  is
  parsed to a working specification which has  one  specification  element  on
  each line with any separating whitespace removed. Immediately after  one  of
  these searches, the parsed specification can be found in the ( @ ) buffer, a
  copy is also preserved in the data object "'=GeneralFindSpec".
  
  Once a search specification has been successfully entered for one  of  these
  functions, it can be re-used any number of times with any of them by  giving
  the relevant escape sequence without entering a new search specification.
  
  A few examples - these work on ${JOT_RESOURCES}/Richard_III_Entire_Play.txt:
> king{Esc f p}
  This will search forwards and will match to  any  paragraph  containing  the
  string "king" although the matching string may be a part of  a  longer  word
  e.g. "looking", "buckingham".
> #king{Esc f p}
  This will search forwards and will match to  any  paragraph  containing  the
  word "king" - rejecting longer words containing the substring "king".
> #king richard{Esc f p}
  This will search forwards and will match to any  paragraph  containing  both
  the exact word "king" and the string "richard" in any order.
> king\ richard{Esc f p}
  This searches forwards and will locate the first  paragraph  containing  the
  string "king richard".
> #king | #prince{Esc f p}
  This will search forwards and will match to  any  paragraph  containing  the
  strings "king" or "prince".
> #ned | edward{Esc f p}
  This will search forwards and will match to  any  paragraph  containing  the
  either exact word "ned" or a simple match with "edward".
> king richard !safe;{Esc f p}
  This will match to the next paragraph  containing  the  strings  "king"  and
  "richard" but pass over any that also contain the string "safe".

1.9 Command-mode vs. insert mode
---------------------------------
  Jot is essentially a command-driven editor. In other words  it  picks  up  a
  command and a  parameter  terminated  by  a  {Return}  (this  is  a  special
  character that is sent when the return key is struck. The editor then  makes
  the requested change to your text image.
  
  Most modern text editors and word processors permanently operate  in  insert
  mode - typing at the keyboard appears directly in the text image. An  insert
  mode of operation is fully supported by jot but it does not insist that  you
  work in this way.
  
  There are a few circumstances when working in insert mode is more efficient,
  perhaps when we're making changes to small section of text  using  only  the
  cursor keys for  navigation.  But  for  pretty-much  every  other  situation
  command-mode operation requires less keystrokes than insert mode.
  
  Thus, to enter a line of text in insert mode, we type in the text  and  then
  hit return. To enter a line of text in command mode, we type  the  text  and
  then hit the appropriate command key. This is because, for a  command-driven
  system, the {Return} key is used exclusively to enter commands and, in  this
  case, we want to enter a line of text.

1.10 About help
--------------
  The jot help system is based on fold marks - a sequence of three open braces
  ( {{{ ) at the start of a line is a fold start, a sequence  of  three  close
  braces ( }}} ) is a fold-end mark. Folds can be nested to any level.
  
  Another type of fold mark is the file-fold mark - these take  the  following
  form:
[<pathstub>]<filename>
  The pathstub is a subpath in the filing system starting at the path  of  the
  current file  fold  (typically  ${JOT_RESOURCES}/help/...  )  and  the  file
  <filename>.hlp must exist in this directory. When opened the file is  merged
  into the help repository.
  
  The <<Help>> function (normally attached to {F1}) looks at the current  line
  in the display.
    - If the current line begins with an open-fold  mark  '{{{'  it  uses  the
      current line as a key and searches the help repository buffer ( : )  for
      a matching entry. It copies the entry to the help view buffer ( ; )  for
      viewing.
    - If the current record does not have a fold mark but the  current  buffer
      is the help viewing buffer ( ;  )  then  the  Help  function  exits  the
      current fold, returning to the parent fold.
    - If the current record contains a file-fold mark  (  [<subpath>]  at  the
      beginning of the line) and the current buffer is the help viewing buffer
      ( ; ) then the file is opened  and  it's  contents  added  to  the  help
      repository buffer ( : ).
    - In all other cases the Help function will open the top-level help entry.
    
    For details about the format and construction of  help  files  see  `About
    help files`.

1.11 About command editing
-------------------------
  Jot is a command-driven text editor so, since it is probably most  used  for
  editing scripts in the  command  language  for  other  text-driven  computer
  applications, it should be pretty good at editing it's own command  language
  right? Er ... well maybe.
  
  The problem is that it's not easy to define a syntax for commands to be used
  for editing the same commands for the  same  command  console  of  the  same
  system. Suppose,  for  example,  we  wanted  to  fix  up  the  sort  of  CLI
  command-line editing we're all familiar with. Even limiting  it's  scope  to
  just the four  cursor-control  keys  the  delete  key  reveals  some  pretty
  horrendous syntactic problems for a text editor editing  the  text  requires
  the same cursor-control operations as the command-editing operations.
  
  Jot gets over this by copying the current contents of  the  command  console
  buffer into an editable buffer so that you can then correct and perfect your
  code to achieve your desired result. When you think  you've  got  there,  it
  copies the result of your labours back into the console buffer ready for you
  to try again.
   
  The standard startup script defines two  functions  for  command  editing  -
  `CmdEditStart` and `CmdEditGo`.
  
  CmdEditStart ( {Esc c e} ) acquires a list of recent commands  and  whatever
  you've been typing to the console area and  displays  this  in  a  temporary
  buffer. In this view you can use normal editing functions to select and,  if
  required, modify a command string.
  
  When the selected command has been suitably modified, use `CmdEditGo` ( {Esc
  c g} ) push your selected and edited command string back  into  the  console
  buffer, ready for you to use in whatever way you fancy.
  
  The editor maintains  an  internal  history  log  containing  the  last  few
  commands. By default this holds the last 20 commands but this limit  can  be
  changed with the `-history` CLI qualifier.
  
  Note that the command history is viewed and edited in the ( - ) buffer.  Now
  one other function also uses the ( - ) buffer - <<`AddNewFunctions`>>  hence
  you avoid using this function  while  editing  commands.  In  practice  this
  restriction should not prove overly burdensome since that function  is  only
  used by scripts to add new functions to the code repository.

1.12 About not losing your work
------------------------------
  There are many and varied ways of mistakenly losing or corrupting work in an
  editing session - jot offers a few ways of making this a bit less easily  to
  do:
  
    - When an editing session has many active buffers it's not always easy  to
      keep track of which have been updated. By setting the  buffer  attribute
      writeifchanged (see `%b=writeifchanged`), if the buffer has been changed
      in any way the `%C` and `%A` commands will refuse to exit with a message
      telling you which buffers require writing. To unset this  attribute  use
      `%b=unrestricted`.
    
    - Request an optional journal file - essentially,  this  can  be  used  to
      recover  a  session  after  an  abnormal  exit.  This  is  part  of  the
      journal-recovery  system  and  is  designed  to  protect  against  power
      failures, flat batteries, crashes etc. (see `about journal files`)
      
  Where one of the attribute-setting approaches is relevant,  to  insure  this
  *always* gets done, add these commands to your project-area startup.jot file
  - see `about project files`.

1.13 About multi-window working
------------------------------
  Jot allows the usable screen area to be allocated to  any  number  of  areas
  known here as windows. The screen may be split horizontally or vertically to
  create displays of some complexity by repeatedly using the `%W` command. The
  range of window types available  using  functions  defined  in  the  startup
  script is more limited - a simple one-window display, screen split into  any
  number of equal-sized horizontal strips or the screen split into any  number
  of equal-sized vertical slices.
  
  The  `WindowOne`  function  gives  a  simple  single-window   display,   the
  `WindowHorizSplit` and `WindowVertSplit` will split the screen.
  
  Various functions operate on  specific  windows  eg:  `PageUp`,  `PageDown`,
  `WindowReassign`, `WindowStretch` and `WindowShrink` - when  there  is  more
  than one screen these functions need to identify the window to be adjusted.
  
  Windows are allocated a window  number  -  this  number  appears  in  `query
  window` reports at the start of each window-description line. Alternatively,
  you can just count windows from 0, starting from the top-left of the  screen
  working from left-to-right and then top-to-bottom.
  
  Sometimes  we  might  like  to  temporarily   revert   to   simpler   window
  configuration - but the current configuration might be difficult and or time
  consuming to restore manually. For this situation there are the `WindowSave`
  and `WindowRestore` functions. WindowSave records details  of  your  current
  window configuration and  then  calls  `WindowOne`  to  change  to  a  basic
  single-window  configuration  and  WindowRestore  re-creates  the   original
  configuration.

1.14 About jot debugging
-----------------------
  Jot supports a simple debugging environment. It is possible to  display  the
  current state of the stack, the current record and breakpoint on a number of
  predefined  conditions  -   see   `the   jot   debugger`,   `%S=trace`   and
  `%s=tracedefault`.
  
  Typically, one might request a breakpoint, a stack dump and display  of  the
  current record at each trace point. With a trace point at every  command  or
  every new command line. It is also possible  to  put  an  explicit  debugger
  request (the `T` command) in the command string.
  
  When the trace vector specifies  a  breakpoint  (see  `%s=trace`),  at  each
  breakpoint dabbing the {Return} key will cause execution to continue to  the
  next breakpoint (the next command if Trace_AllCommands is set, the start  of
  the next command line if Trace_CommandLines is set ...). 
  
  By default, the `DebuggerQuit` function will reset the trace vector so  that
  execution continues normally. If DebuggerQuit is given a  numeric  argument,
  it applies the argument to the `%s=traceskip` command. This causes execution
  to skip to the end of the selected block, macro, function or script.
  
  The debugger is controlled by the following commands:
    - `%s=trace` - redefines the trace vector with immediate effect.
      
    - `%s=tracedefault` - defines the trace vector to be set by `T`  commands,
      the command counter `%s=commandcounter` and (optionally - see  below)  a
      {Ctrl+c} interrupt.
      
    - `%s=traceskip` - disables tracing actions until the block/call level has
      fallen below a specified value.
      
    - `T` - An explicit debugger request a T command can be  inserted  at  any
      point in a macro or directly in the command line, this changes the trace
      vector to the value defined by  `%s=tracedefault`.  To  exit  the  debug
      prompt loop, reset the trace vector with %s=trace 0, or {Esc q}.
      
    - The normal behaviour for {Ctrl+c} interrupts is to exit all  macros  and
      command files and return to  the  jot  prompt.  Setting  Trace_Int  (see
      `%s=trace`) will cause it instead go to the interactive  debugger.  here
      you can single-step and use any valid jot commands to investigate what's
      going on.       
      
    - Often, the explicit trace command is buried in a  complicated  loop  and
      control structure which makes it necessary to  continue  many,  possibly
      hundreds of times before reaching the iteration causing the problem. The
      %s=commandcounter command (see  `%s=commandcounter`)  sets  the  initial
      state of an internal counter  which  triggers  a  trace  point  when  it
      reaches zero.
      
      The internal command counter is normally  reset  to  zero  as  each  new
      command line is read from the console. The counter is unsigned long long
      so it normally  takes  a  very  long  time  to  reach  zero  again.  The
      %s=commandcounter command automatically calculates the correct value  to
      stop at the specified point. Note that,  for  the  purposes  of  command
      counting, the block and logical constructs " ( ) , ? and \ "  all  count
      as commands.
      
    - Changing the verbosity level (see `%s=verbose`) may help - setting  this
      to 2 causes more information about failures to be displayed. By default,
      it only displays the messages from the outermost failing block,  level-2
      verbosity displays all of them as it unwinds. e.g:
$ jot t.t -in="(ol123)1000"
{-init sequence failed. (line 1 of buffer i)} (ol123)1000
      Clearly it's a stack  overflow  that's  the  problem  -  but  it's  only
      reporting that the outer block failed - now try this:
$ jot t.t -in="%s=verbose 2; (ol123)1000"
{Stack overflow (line 1 of buffer i)} %s=verbose 2; (ol123)1000
{-init sequence failed. (line 1 of buffer i)} %s=verbose 2; (ol123)1000
  
    - jot has a simple backtrace facility - see  `query  backtrace`,  `bt.jot`
      and also the notes on Trace_Backtrace in `%s=trace`.
      
  Note that line numbers reported in error messages etc. refer to lines in the
  code-repository ( ' ) buffer - not line numbers in your script.  One  simple
  way of dealing with this problem is to set the line numbers in  your  script
  to match those in the code repository.  First  identify  a  line  from  your
  script in the repository (buffer ( ' ) ) and  note  it's  line  number  (say
  999). Then go to the same line in  your  script  and  set  the  line  number
  thusly:
> ol999o.
  Henceforth, all line numbers in warnings etc.  will  be  in  alignment  with
  those in your source script. The linenumbers will go back to normal when you
  open a new editing session on your script so it is suggested that  you  keep
  the session open.

1.15 About block graphics
-------------------------
  Jot offers some limited support for  the  creation  of  simple  line-drawing
  diagrams, flow-charts electrical schematics etc.
  
  The support consists of  functions  for  drawing  horizontal,  vertical  and
  diagonal lines, some some cursor  positioning  functions  specific  to  line
  drawings and a block move function.
   
  If, while drawing, an attempt is made to go  above  the  top  or  below  the
  bottom boundary of the buffer or there is an attempt to draw past the end of
  a line then additional lines and/or whitespace is automatically added.
  
  By default jot will insert simple ASCII characters Hyphen (  -  ),  Vertical
  bar ( | ), Slash ( / ) and Backslash (  \  )  but  the  appropriate  unicode
  characters are available as an option ( 
  
  If the diagrams are to be  part  of  a  document  to  be  processed  by  the
  document-preparation functions and scripts  (`doc2html.jot`,  `doc2fold.jot`
  and `html2txt.jot`) (see `text document preparation`) then it  is  important
  that the first character of each line in the graphical section  begins  with
  any character other than an ascii space - an ASCII VT (tab) will do.
  
  It attempts to tidy corners when shifting between  horizontal  and  vertical
  lines and similarly with diagonals. Hence a series of <<LineE>> followed  by
  a <<LineS>> will  remove  the  last  hyphen  (  -  )  and  replace  it  with
  whitespace. Diagonals join  up  tidily  without  extra  whitespace  but  the
  drawing functions adjust the cursor position as appropriate e.g:
                          
	     ----      /\     \     ----                                  \
	    |    |    /  \     \   |    |     \        /        /\          \
	    |    |   /    \    /   |    |       \    /        /    \        /
	     ----             /     ----          \/        /        \    /
	
	    ┌───┐     ┏━━━━┓     ╔════╗ 
	    │   │     ┃    ┃     ║    ║ 
	    │   │     ┃    ┃     ║    ║ 
	    └───┘     ┗━━━━┛     ╚════╝ 
  
  The unicode characters are selected using the `LineDefaultChrs` function.
                                                                 
  For details take a look at `line-drawing functions`:
    - `LineN`, `LineS`, `LineE`, `LineW` - functions for drawing north,  south
      east and west, `LineNE`,  `LineNW`,  `LineSW`,  `LineSE`  functions  for
      drawing simple diagonals.
      
    - `DSLineNE`, `DSLineNW`, `DSLineSW`, `DSLineSE` (Double Spaced) - similar
      to the other diagonal-drawing  functions  except  that  they  add  extra
      whitespace in order to get the diagonal at something more like 45deg. to
      the horizontal.
       
    - `CutRectangle` and `PasteRectangle` - these deal with copying and moving
      rectangular blocks of text.
      
    - `UpRegardless` and `DownRegardless` these  are  cursor-moving  functions
      unconstrained  by  the  text  envelope.  They  add  more  lines   and/or
      whitespace as they go.
      
    - The `Overwrite` function is also useful when handling block graphics  as
      it preserves the position of succeeding characters on the line.
      
    - There are also some functions for simple manipulation of rectangles:
      - `rotateDiagonal` - rotates the contents of a text  buffer  around  the
        leading diagonal,
      - `rotateHorizontal` - reverses the order of the lines in a buffer and
      - `rotateVertical` - reverses the order of  the  columns  in  a  buffer,
        adding padding blanks where necessary.

2 Keyboard functions defined at startup
---------------------------------------
  The startup.jot script defines the  functions  described  in  the  following
  sections.
  
  In the description of functions dealing  with  paragraphs,  a  paragraph  is
  deemed to be a block of lines bounded by completely blank  lines  -  i.e.  a
  line which does not even contain whitespace.
  
  In the description of functions dealing with words, JOT defines a word as  a
  string  containing  upper  and  lower-case  alpha  characters,  digits   and
  underscores. Unfortunately, at present, all unicode characters  are  treated
  as non-alpha characters.
  
  The functions described here are defined by  the  `startup.jot`  file  which
  also links then to the keyboard, the keycodes are are defined in a  separate
  file `curses_keys_<TERM>.jot` and `WindowsNT_keys.jot`.

2.1 Help functions.
-------------------
  Jot help reads a top-level help menu at startup time. This is  displayed  on
  the first call for help. A help category is  selected  by  navigating  to  a
  line, using the cursor-control keys and hitting the  help  button  (normally
  F1) once more.
  
  The initial help categories are file  folds  -  they  all  have  a  pathname
  specification of the form [<path>]<name>, as the file folds are opened,  the
  relevant file is read and it's top-level fold  headings  is  displayed.  The
  internal fold headings begin with '{{{' at the start of the line. These  can
  be opened and descended into by navigating the cursor to  them  and  hitting
  the help button again.
  
  The help structure can be ascended by navigating to and  non-fold  line  and
  hitting the help button once more.
  
  In addition to the `Help`, `FindAllHelp` and `RemoveHelpFold` the  following
  scripts may be useful `updatehelp.jot`, `findhelp.jot` and `txt2help.jot`
  
2.1.1 Help
----------
> [<helpQuery>]{F1}
  
  Searches the help database for an entry with a name matching the  helpKey  -
  if no helpKey specified but the cursor is on a help fold the fold is  opened
  if not on a help fold then the current help fold  is  closed  -  see  `about
  help`.
    
2.1.2 FindAllHelp
-----------------
>  [<string>]{Shift+F1}
  
  Searches the currently-opened help documents in the help repository  (the  :
  buffer) for matches with string, help menu is set up with matching entries.
  
2.1.3 RemoveHelpFold
--------------------
> {Ctrl+F1}
  
  The contents of the current fold is removed, if it's a file  fold  then  the
  file-fold marker is restored.

2.2 Delete and Restore
----------------------
  The functions to do with deletion of bits of text are all  attached  to  the
  left/right keys.
  
  Text is deleted by moving it to the delete-bin buffer ( % ).  When  deleting
  left it goes to the front of the buffer, when deleting right it is moved  to
  the end of the delete-bin buffer. The distinction is important  because,  to
  preserve the original order, text is restored character-by-character in  the
  reverse direction.
  
  The restore functions all restore to the current character position  -  they
  will effectively reinstate the original text provided:
    - 1/ the cursor is in the same position as when the deletion finished,
    - 2/ you don't overdo it and restore some other old junk from some earlier
      delete operation
  It is, of course, possible to use the select and restore functions  to  move
  text by first deleting, moving the cursor and then restoring.
  
2.2.1 DeleteChrLeft
-------------------
> {Alt+LeftArrow}
  The character immediately to the left of the cursor is moved to  the  delete
  bin. If the cursor is at the start of a line, the  current  line  is  joined
  with the previous one.
  
2.2.2 DeleteChrRight
--------------------
> {Alt+RightArrow}
  
  The character immediately below the cursor is moved to the  delete  bin.  If
  the cursor is at the end of a line, the current  line  is  joined  with  the
  next.
  
2.2.3 DeleteWordLeft
--------------------
> {Shift+Alt+LeftArrow}
  
  The word immediately to the left of the cursor is moved to the start of  the
  delete bin. If the cursor is at the start of a line,  the  current  line  is
  joined with the previous one and it's last word is deleted.
  
2.2.4 DeleteWordRight
---------------------
> {Shift+Alt+RightArrow}
   
  The word immediately to the right of the cursor is moved to the end  of  the
  delete bin. If the cursor is at the end of  a  line,  the  current  line  is
  joined with the next and it's first word is deleted.
  
2.2.5 DeleteLineLeft
--------------------
> {Ctrl+Alt+LeftArrow}
   
  All of the line immediately to the left of the cursor is moved to the  start
  delete bin. If the cursor is at the start of a line,  the  current  line  is
  joined with the previous one.
  
2.2.6 DeleteLineRight
---------------------
> {Ctrl+Shift+Alt+RightArrow}
   
  All of the line immediately to the right of the cursor is moved to  the  end
  of the delete bin. If the cursor is at the end of a line, the  current  line
  is joined with the next one.
  
2.2.7 RestoreChrLeft
--------------------
> {Ctrl+Shift+Alt+LeftArrow}
   
  The  first  character  in  the   delete-bin   buffer   is   moved   to   the
  current-character position of the current buffer.
  
2.2.8 RestoreWordLeft
---------------------
> {Esc - l w}
  
  The first word in the delete-bin buffer is moved  to  the  current-character
  position of the current buffer.
  
2.2.9 RestoreLineLeft
---------------------
> {Esc - l l}
  
  The first line in the delete-bin buffer is moved  to  the  current-character
  position of the current buffer.
  
2.2.10 RestoreChrRight
----------------------
> {Ctrl+Shift+Alt+RightArrow}
   
  The  last  character  in   the   delete-bin   buffer   is   moved   to   the
  current-character position of the current buffer and becomes the new current
  character.
  
2.2.11 RestoreWordRight
-----------------------
> {Esc r w}
  
  The last word in the delete-bin buffer is  moved  to  the  current-character
  position of the current buffer.
  
2.2.12 RestoreLineRight
-----------------------
> {Esc r l}
  
  The last line in the delete-bin buffer is  moved  to  the  current-character
  position of the current buffer.

2.3 Find, substitute and insert
-------------------------------
  Arguably the most basic of all editor functions are  finding  and  replacing
  text F5 to F9 are used for these operations  with  a  few  special  flavours
  obtained using the Shift, Ctrl and Alt keys.
 
2.3.1 FindNext
--------------
> [<string>]{F8}
  
  Find the next occurrence of the specified string, if no string is  specified
  then the string used in the last find is used.
  
2.3.2 SubsThenFindNx
--------------------
> {Shift+F8}
  Parameterless,  repeats  last  substitution  then  find  next.  i.e.  repeat
  previous substitution, then repeat last find.
  
2.3.3 FindNextAgain
-------------------
> {Ctrl+F8}
  
  In insert mode, the FindNext function will  always  prompt  for  the  search
  string. FindNextAgain will just apply the last-used search-string  parameter
  once again.
  
  This function is provided for the benefit of insert-mode users - repeats the
  most recent search without  re-prompting.  It's  entirely  useless  when  in
  command mode - these users need only dab F8 again to repeat the search.
  
2.3.4 FindExactNext
-------------------
> [<string>]{F9}
  
  The buffer is searched until the next exact-match occurrence of the word  is
  found - in this context an exact match is where the  matching  substring  is
  bounded by non-alphanumeric characters.
    
2.3.5 FindExactPrev
-------------------
> [<string>]{Shift+F9}
  
  Similar to above, except that it searches backwards.
  
2.3.6 SetFindString
-------------------
> {Ctrl+F9}
   
  The word below the cursor is picked up and defines the find string  for  the
  next find (or find exact) operation.
  
2.3.7 FindPrev
---------------
> [<string>]{F7}
   
  Find the previous occurrence of  the  specified  string,  if  no  string  is
  specified then the string used in the last find is used.
  
2.3.8 SubsThenFindPv
--------------------
> {Shift+F7}
  
  Parameterless  substitute  then   find   previous.   i.e   repeat   previous
  substitution then find previous occurrence of last-found string.
  
2.3.9 FindPrevAgain
-------------------
> {Alt+F7}
  
  In insert mode, the FindPrev function will  always  prompt  for  the  search
  string. FindPrevAgain will just apply the last-used search-string  parameter
  once again.
  
  This function is provided for the benefit of insert-mode users - repeats the
  most recent search without  re-prompting.  It's  entirely  useless  when  in
  command mode - these users need only dab F7 again to repeat their search.

2.3.10 FindWild
---------------
> [<string>]{Esc f w}
  This searches for the next occurrence of a string  containing  one  or  more
  wildcards ( * ). The argument list is parsed and held in buffer @.
  
  If no argument is given then it matches to whatever happens to be in  the  @
  buffer.
   
2.3.11 FindWildPrev
-------------------
> [<string>]{Esc - f w}
  This searches for the previous occurrence of a string containing one or more
  wildcards ( * ). The argument list is parsed and held in buffer @.
  
  If no argument is given then it matches to whatever happens to be in  the  @
  buffer.

2.3.12 FindPhraseNext
---------------------
> [<substringSpecification>]{Esc f r}
  
  Working forwards, this  locates  the  next  phrase  containing  all  of  the
  substrings in the substrings list. On successful completion,  it  highlights
  the matching substrings in your specification. If unsuccessful,  the  cursor
  is left at the end of the file image and a message is issued.
  
  A phrase is any number of words, extending over any number of lines  bounded
  by normal punctuation marks or the  start  or  end  of  the  buffer.  Normal

  Similar to FindParaNext except that the allowable range is an entire  block.
  Blocks are any number of lines of text bounded by an completely  blank  line
  (i.e. containing not even blanks) or the buffer end. 
  
  FindBlockNext locates the next block containing all of the substrings in the
  substrings list. On successful completion, it highlights the last  substring

> [<apertureSize> [<substr1>[ <substr2>[ ... ]]{Esc f n}
  Similar to `FindLineUn` except that it allows the substrings to be scattered
  over a specified number of lines.  The  aperture  size  (maximum  number  of
  lines) including any blank and any other non-text lines,  this  must  be  in
  decimal.
  
  E.g the following:
> 5 wonderful super\ duper amazing{Esc f n}
  
  will search the document for the strings 
    "wonderful", "super duper" and "amazing"
  which may appear in any order and must appear in a block of 5 lines or less.
  
2.3.25 FindInNLinesPrev
-----------------------
> [<apertureSize> [<substr1>[ <substr2>[ ... ]]{Esc - f n}
  Similar to `FindInNLines` except that it  searches  back  from  the  current
  cursor position, towards the start of the file image.

2.3.26 FindSequence
------------------
> [<string>]{Esc f q}
  The  editor  will  search  for  the   sequence   of   words   ignoring   any
  non-alphanumeric delimiters including line breaks. One or more words can  be
  represented by the wildcard character ( * ). The argument list is parsed and
  held in buffer @.
  
  If no argument is given then it matches to whatever happens to be in  the  @
  buffer.
  
  This is function is useful for locating sequences of words after  they  have
  been reformatted in some way, with wildcards it is also useful for  locating
  expressions in programming code.
  
2.3.27 FindSequencePrev
----------------------
> [<string>] {Esc - f q} 
  Similar to FindSequence except that it searches back towards  the  start  of
  the file.
  
2.3.28 FindLineOrd
------------------
> [<substr1>[ <substr2>[ ... ]]{Esc f o}
  This finds the next  occurrence  of  a  line  containing  that  sequence  of
  substrings in the order specified.
  
  The list of substrings is delimited by blanks,  sequences  of  two  or  more
  blanks are treated as a single blank. If a substring contains  blanks  these
  are escaped with a backslash character ( \ ) e.g:
> substring1 substring2 substring\ containing\ blanks lastSubstring{Esc f p}
  
2.3.29 FindLineOrdPrev
----------------------
> [<substr1>[ <substr2>[ ... ]]{Esc - f o}
  This is similar to `FindLineOrd` except that it works back from the  current
  line towards the start of the file image.
  
2.3.30 FindLineUn
-----------------
> [<substr1>[ <substr2>[ ... ]]{Esc f u}
  Very similar to `FindLineOrd` except that it matches to  a  line  containing
  the given substrings in any order. On successful completion,  it  highlights
  the last of the given substrings. If it fails to find a  matching  line,  it
  leaves the cursor at the end of the file image.
  
  The list of substrings is delimited by blanks,  sequences  of  two  or  more
  blanks are treated as a single blank. If a substring contains  blanks  these
  are escaped with a backslash character ( \ ) e.g:
> substring1 substring2 substring\ containing\ blanks lastSubstring{Esc f p}
  
2.3.31 FindLineUnPrev
---------------------
> [<substr1>[ <substr2>[ ... ]]{Esc - f u}
  Very similar to `FindLineUn` except that  it  searches  backwards  from  the
  current line towards the start of the file image.

2.3.32 The vertical-search functions
------------------------------------
  All of the find functions  encountered  so  far  match  to  strings  written
  horizontally across one or more lines, the vertical find functions accept  a
  normal horizontally-written search-string parameter specification but  match
  to a series of characters written vertically down in  a  column.  The  first
  character in the specification matches to the character topmost character in
  the matching column, the second to the the character immediately below, etc.
  
  All these functions support a limited selection of special characters:
    - ( . ) - simple wildcard - matches to any character.
    - ( ) blank - ignored, may be used to define column structure  to  improve
      readability.
    - ( \ ) backslash - used to escape instances of special characters ( .  ),
      ( * ), ( \ ) and blank ( ) - i.e: to match one of the special characters
      prefix the character with a backslash.
    - ( * ) -  Only  in  findRectNext  and  findRectPrev  functions  -  column
      wildcard. This matches to any number of columns, this is only meaningful
      in the leftmost column  of  the  specification  (the  top  line  of  the
      matching block).
    
    - `findColNext` and `findColPrev`  locate  the  specified  string  in  the
      current column.
    - `findVertNext` and `findVertPrev` locate the  specified  string  in  any
      column.
    - `findRectNext` and `findRectPrev` locate a rectangular block of text.
    
  For examples of the syntax look at `Locating text in columns and blocks`  in
  the walkthrough examples.
  
2.3.32.1 findColNext
--------------------
> [<string>]{Esc f l}
  
  Searches forwards (down) in the current  column  for  the  specified  string
  written downwards in the  current  column.  If  the  search  string  is  not
  specified then it searches for  the  last  string  given  for  any  vertical
  search.
  
2.3.32.2 findColPrev
--------------------
> [<string>]{Esc - f l}
  
  Searches back (up) in the current column for the  specified  string  written
  downwards in the current column. If the search string is not specified  then
  it searches for the last string given for any vertical search.
  
2.3.32.3 findVertNext
---------------------
> [<string>]{Esc f v}
  
  Searches forwards (down) in all columns for  the  specified  string  written
  downwards in any column. If the search  string  is  not  specified  then  it
  searches for the last string given for any vertical search.
  
2.3.32.4 findVertPrev
---------------------
> [<string>]{Esc - f v}
  
  Searches back (up) in all columns for the specified string written downwards
  in any column. If the search string is not specified then  it  searches  for
  the last string given for any vertical search.
  
2.3.32.5 findRectNext
---------------------
> [<key>]{Esc f e}
  
  The  function  searches  for  a  rectangular  block  of  text   matching   a
  specification.
  
  The key defines a buffer containing the search specification, this defines a
  rectangular array of characters to be located (see below for  details).  The
  specification is copied into a data object which will be used for subsequent
  findVertNext/Prev searches with no  key  specified.  If  no  buffer  key  is
  specified then it reverts to the previously-defined specification.
  
  Each line of the specification defines a column  to  be  identified  in  the
  search buffer. As usual, case sensitivity is set by the `%s=case` command.
      
2.3.32.6 findRectPrev
---------------------
> [<key>]{Esc - f e}
  
  This is similar to findRectNext except that it searches  backwards  (up  the
  screen towards the begining of the buffer.

2.3.33 Substitute
-----------------
> [<string>]{F5}
  
  Replaces currently-selected substring  with  the  specified  string,  if  no
  string is specified then the last-substituted or inserted string is used.
  
2.3.34 Remove
-------------
> {Shift+F5}
  
  The previously-selected string  (following  a  find,  substitute  etc.),  is
  removed altogether.
  
2.3.35 SubstituteAgain
----------------------
> {Alt+F5}
  
  In insert mode, the Substitute function will always prompt  for  the  search
  string. SubstituteAgain will  just  apply  the  last-used  substitute-string
  parameter once again.
  
  This function is provided for the benefit of insert-mode users as it repeats
  a substitution without re-prompting. It's entirely useless when  in  command
  mode - where it is only necessary to dab F5 again to repeat the substitution
  at some new location.
  
2.3.36 Insert
-------------
> [<string>]{F6}
  
  Inserts specified text at the current-character position, if  no  string  is
  specified then the last-substituted or inserted string is used.
  
2.3.37 Overwrite
----------------
> [<string>]{Shift+F6}
  
  The characters under and to the right of the current cursor are replaced  by
  the specified string. If no string is specified, then the last  string  used
  in an insert or substitute operation is used.
  
  The overwrite function is useful when editing tabular data.
  
2.3.38 InsertAgain
------------------
> {Alt+F6}
  
  In insert mode, the Insert  function  will  always  prompt  for  the  insert
  string. InsertAgain will just apply the last-used insert-string once again.
  
  This function is provided for the benefit of insert-mode users as it repeats
  an insert without re-prompting. It's entirely useless when in command mode -
  where it is only necessary to dab F6 again to repeat the insert at some  new
  location.
  
2.3.39 InsertWithBackTick
-------------------------
> [<String>]{Esc ’}
  
  The `Insert` function can insert any string that does not contain the  ASCII
  backtick (or grave) character ( ’ ). That's because the Insert function uses
  this character as a delimiter to introduce the user-specified  string.  This
  is not usually a problem but, if it is, the InsertWithBackTick  function  is
  designed to fill that gap.
  
  InsertWithBackTick inserts the specified string, appends a backtick and then
  sets the substring extent to cover the string and backtick. If the  optional
  string arg is omitted, it inserts only the backtick.
  
 Note:
  This section may not display properly, even if it does,  sharp-eyed  readers
  will have noticed backtick-like character used here is not a backtick (ASCII
  code 96) but unicode left-single-quote character (UTF-8 code  E2,  80,  9C).
  This is because backticks are reserved for the introduction of hyperlinks in
  these documents.

2.4 Text Document Preparation
-----------------------------
  The startup  script offers  a  suite  of  basic  text-document  preparation
  functions.
[<string>]{KP_Enter}       `Enter` - enters a new line of text below the cursor.
[<string>]{Esc e}          `Enter` - as above for those without a {KP_Enter} key.
          {Alt+F9}         `AppendLeftPrev` - Appends left-of-cursor text to previous line.
          {Alt+F10}        `AppendRightNext` - Appends right-of-cursor text to next line.
          {Shift+Alt+F9}   `JoinLeftPrev` - join current line with previous.
          {Shift+Alt+F10}  `JoinRightNext` - join current line with next.
          {Ctrl+Shift+F9}  `IndentFromPrev` - inherit previous line's indentation.
          {Ctrl+Shift+F10} `IndentFromNext` - inherit next line's indentation.
          {Shift+F10}      `Break` - breaks the current line at cursor.
          {Esc p a}        `ReformatParagraph` tops, tails and reformats current PAragraph
          {Esc P a}        `ReFormatAll` tops, tails and reformats tails All Paragraphs
          {Esc p m}        `SetParagraphMargin` sets the left and right margins for each paragraph.
          {Esc b u}        `MakeParagraphIntoBullet` makes current paragraph a bullet point.
          {Esc c u}        `CentreAndUnderlineText` Centres and Underlines text on current line.
          {Esc u l}        `UnderlineThisLine` UnderLines current line.
          {Esc r j}        `RightJustifyLine` Right-Justifies current line.
[proforma]{Esc h e}        `ConvertLineToHeading` Converts current line into a HEading.
          {Esc h +}        `UpHeadingLevel` Converts current line into a heading at a next-higher heading level.
          {Esc h -}        `DownHeadingLevel` Converts current line into a heading at a next-lower heading level.
          {Esc h a}        `PurgeAllHeadings` All section numbers are updated, preserving heading levels.
          {Esc s p}        `SpellcheckParagraph` Checks Spelling of current Paragraph.
          {Esc s c}        `SpellcheckChapter` Checks Spelling of current chapter.
          {Esc s d}        `SpellcheckDocument` Checks Spelling of complete Document.
     Word {Esc s w}        `SpellcheckWord` Checks Spelling of a single word offered as a parameter.
          {Esc s i}        `NextSpellInstance` Goes to next instance of misspelled word.
          {Esc s n}        `NextMisspelling` Goes to Next word in Spelling-errors list.
          {Esc s f}        `FixSpelling` Fix spelling error - substitutes word with one selected from popup menu.
   [<RE>] {Esc s x}        `SpellLexicon` grep for regular expression in Lexicon.

2.4.1 Enter
------------
> [<string>]{KP_Enter}
  or
> [<string>]{Esc e}
  
  The string is inserted as a  new  line  with  indent  level  inherited  from
  previous line. If no string is given then creates a blank line at  the  same
  indent level as the line above. This function only useful in command mode.
  
2.4.2 ReformatParagraph
-----------------------
> {Esc p a} 
  
  Re-formats the current paragraph, the paragraph is deemed to be the  current
  line and all the adjacent lines with the same  indent  level.  This  adjusts
  whitespace between words to align line endings, the line-length to  aim  for
  is set by the `SetParagraphMargin` function.
  
  If the paragraph with a bullet mark (typically a dash followed by  at  least
  one blank) then the length of the bullet mark is included in the indentation
  calculation.
  
  The jot word processor takes a paragraph as any number of nonblank lines  of
  text at the same level of indentation but note that the paragraph definition
  used by the startup-defined functions is less strict - for these functions a
  paragraph is any number of lines bounded by blank lines. These functions are
  `ChapterUp`,      `ChapterDown`,       `FindParaNext`,       `FindParaPrev`,
  `FindChapterNext` and `FindChapterPrev` - See `about words, lines,  phrases,
  sentences, paragraphs, sections and chapters`.
  
  A line of text can be protected from the paragraph processor ({Esc p a}  and
  {Esc P a}) by placing a non-blank character in column 1 - in this context  a
  tab is taken as a non-blank character.
  
2.4.3 ReFormatAll
-----------------
> {Esc P a}
  
  Reformats all  paragraphs  (as  described  in  `ReformatParagraph`)  in  the
  current buffer.

2.4.4 SetParagraphMargin
------------------
> [n]{Esc p m}
  
  Sets the right margin to the specified column,  if  not  specified  then  it
  defaults to two character positions less than the  current  terminal  width.
  This is used for reformatting paragraphs - see `ReformatParagraph`.

2.4.5 RightJustifyLine
----------------------
> {Esc r j}
   
  Indents current line with sufficient blanks to shift the righthand extremity
  of the current line to the right margin (defaults to 78 characters,  set  by
  the `SetParagraphMargin` function.

2.4.6 MakeParagraphIntoBullet
-----------------------------
> {Esc b u}
  
  Reformats current paragraph as a bullet-point paragraph.

2.4.7 CentreAndUnderlineText
----------------------------
> {Esc c u}
  
  The text in the current line is indented with sufficient blanks to  position
  it approximately in the centre of the line. The line is then underlined with
  hyphens.
  
2.4.8 UnderlineThisLine
-----------------------
> {Esc u l}
  
2.4.9 ConvertLineToHeading
--------------------------
> [ProformaHeadingKey]{Esc h e}
  
  Makes the current line into a section heading. e.g:
> 0{Esc h e} - makes current line next top-level heading
  In fact, the section number given here is ignored - only the header level is
  significant, the header  index  numbers  are  inherited  from  the  previous
  heading. So this will have exactly the same effect:
> 999{Esc h e}
  
  But
> 12.34.56.78{Esc h e}   - makes current line next level-4 heading
  Again, the section numbers given here  are  ignored  -  so  this  will  have
  exactly the same effect:
> ...{Esc h e}           - makes current line level-4 heading
       
  Section headings are in two sections separated by whitespace. The first part
  is a key of the form <n1>[.<n2>[.<n3>...]] e.g. 9.3.99, the second  part  is
  any text string e.g:
    123.456.789 An example of a section heading.
   
  The heading level is determined  by  the  previous  heading  but  the  final
  counter is incremented. If the current line has any kind  of  header  level,
  this is taken as a proforma and the new header  level  will  have  the  same
  number of levels but will inherit the numbering from the previous heading.
  
  If  a  proformaHeadingKey  is  given  this  defines  the  proforma  and  any
  preexisting heading key is ignored.
  
  By default, headings below level 4 (i.e. 1.2.3.4...)  are  underlined,  this
  behaviour is controlled by the number in line 4 of the & buffer.
       
2.4.10 UpHeadingLevel
--------------------
> {Esc h +}
  
  Makes the current line into a section heading,  the  heading  level  is  one
  higher than the previous heading.
   
2.4.11 DownHeadingLevel
----------------------
  
> {Esc h -}
  
  Makes the current line into a section heading,  the  heading  level  is  one
  lower than the previous heading.
  
2.4.12 PurgeAllHeadings
----------------------
> {Esc h a}
  
  Resets all headings, the heading levels are unchanged,  but  out-of-sequence
  section numbers are  redefined  -  use  this  after  inserting  or  removing
  sections.

2.4.13 SpellcheckDocument
------------------------
> {Esc s d}
  
  Checks the entire document for spelling errors using aspell (a GNU  spelling
  checker), if the there is a spell.lis file in  the  same  directory  as  the
  document, then this is passed to the aspell checker. The list of  misspelled
  words is read into the @ buffer - see the `SpellcheckParagraph` , below.
  
  Some versions of aspell offer a selection of suggested corrections,  if  jot
  detects these then it displays them in a popup menu -  see  `the  popup-menu
  functions` `of mice and menus` and `about menus`.
      
  Linux users may find an aspell with their distribution.  There  are  several
  similar spelling checkers but aspell can be used in  command  mode  with  an
  error report sent to stdout. Most others insist on you using their  gui.  If
  your  distro  does  not  have  it  or  you  are  a  windows  user  then  try
  http://aspell.net
  
  The original ASpell report is held in the ( # ) buffer, should you  want  to
  see this.
  
2.4.14 SpellcheckChapter
------------------------
> {Esc s c} 
  
  Checks only the current chapter for spelling errors but in other respects is
  the same as `SpellcheckParagraph`. A  chapter  being  any  number  of  lines
  bounded  by  either  a  chapter  heading  or  the  document  top  or  bottom
  boundaries. A chapter  heading  being  any  line  beginning  with  an  alpha
  character in column  1  -  see  `about  words,  lines,  phrases,  sentences,
  paragraphs, sections and chapters`.
  
2.4.15 SpellcheckParagraph
-------------------------
> {Esc s p} 
  
  Checks only the current paragraph for spelling errors but in other  respects
  is the same as `SpellcheckParagraph`.
  
2.4.16 SpellcheckWord
---------------------
[<word>]{Esc s w}
  
  Passes the given word through the spelling checker  the  checkers  suggested
  corrections are displayed in the popup menu (see  `SpellcheckDocument`).  If
  no word is given, then it takes the word under or immediately to the left of
  the cursor.
  
  The raw aspell results are held in the ( # ) buffer.

2.4.17 NextMisspelling
----------------------
> {Esc s n}
  
  Moves  to  the  next  misspelled  word  found  by  `SpellcheckDocument`   or
  `SpellcheckParagraph` . If there are no more instances, then  moves  to  the
  next word in the @ (misspelled words) buffer and finds the first instance of
  that.
  
2.4.18 NextSpellInstance
------------------------
> {Esc s i}
  
  Moves to  the  next  instance  of  the  current  misspelled  word  found  by
  `SpellcheckDocument`  or  `SpellcheckParagraph`.  If  there  are   no   more
  instances, then calls `NextMisspelling` to move to the next misspelled  word
  in the aspell report.
  
2.4.19 FixSpelling
------------------
> <word>{Esc s f}
  
  First select a spelling correction from the popup menu then {Esc  s  f}  the
  original word is replaced by the selected word  and  the  popup  disappears.
  Note, FixSpelling will work even if the popup has disappeared  -  making  it
  useful where there are several instances of the same misspelling.
  
  Nb: To remove the spelling-suggestions popup re-draw the  windows  with  the
  `WindowOne` function {Esc w 1}.
    
2.4.20 SpellLexicon
-------------------
> <RE>{Esc s x}
  
  This launches grep, which has been set up to  find  matching  words  in  the
  lexicon.
  
  This is sometimes useful for looking up  spellings,  the  lexicon  is  quite
  small so there are plenty of valid words that don't match but, on  the  plus
  side, it unlikely to match archaic  or  obscure  words  that  hardly  anyone
  knows.

2.4.21 Doc section and paragraph format
---------------------------------------
  Typically, most lines of of text in documents are in  paragraphs.  Paragraph
  lines are always indented by at least one blank.  In  order  to  distinguish
  paragraph lines from special text such as headings, tables and literal  text
  such as code examples these must have a  non-blank  character  in  column  1
  (tabs count as non-blanks for this purpose).
  
  Text documents are deemed to consist of sections, introduced  by  a  section
  heading and containing any number of paragraphs.
   
  Several scripts are designed to text documents  in  document  format,  these
  make the following assumptions about the structuring of the text - see `text
  document preparation`.
   
    - Numbered sections always start in column 0, may contain  any  number  of
      subsection numbers, each delimited by a decimal point the section number
      is terminated by whitespace, followed by the section name e.g:
> 12.4.9 This section is a child of section 12.4 and grandchild of section 12
       
    - In addition to numbered sections, a section name may start at  column  0
      and be terminated by a colon,  which  me,  optionally,  be  followed  by
      section text e.g:
Fred: This is name frequently used by unimaginative technical authors.
  
    - Bullet points are  paragraphs  introduced  by  a  bullet  character,  by
      default these are hyphens ( - ) the actual bullet string is  defined  in
      line 4 of the ( & ) buffer.
      
    - A paragraph is a series of  lines,  all  indented  to  the  same  level,
      delimited by either blank lines, special lines or  by  paragraphs  at  a
      different level of indentation.
      
      The rightmost extent of a paragraph  defaults  to  78  characters,  this
      width is defined in line 3 of the ( & ) buffer.

2.4.22 AppendLeftPrev
---------------------
> {Alt+F9}
  
  Appends text to the left of the current character to the end of the previous
  line, preserving indentation of both lines.
  
2.4.23 AppendRightNext
----------------------
> {Alt+F10}
  
  Appends text under and to the right of the current character, to  the  start
  of the next line, preserving the indentation of both lines.
    
2.4.24 JoinLeftPrev
------------------
> {Shift+Alt+F9}
  
  Joins  current  line  to  end  of  previous  line,   excluding   indentation
  whitespace. It also adds a gratuitous blank if it deems this necessary.
  
2.4.25 JoinRightNext
-------------------
> {Shift+Alt+F10} 
  
  Joins current line to the start of  the  next  line,  excluding  indentation
  whitespace. It also adds a gratuitous blank if it deems this necessary.
  
2.4.26 IndentFromPrev
---------------------
> {Ctrl+Shift+F9}
  
  Removes all indentation blanks from the current line and replaces them  with
  those from the previous line.
   
2.4.27 IndentFromNext
---------------------
> {Ctrl+Shift+F10}
  
  Removes all indentation blanks from the current line and replaces them  with
  those from the next line.
  
2.4.28 Break
-----------
> {Shift+F10}
  
  This breaks the current line at the current character position. Text to  the
  right of the break ends up on the next line, this inherits indentation  from
  the original line.
  
2.4.29 Join
----------
> {Ctrl+F10}
  
   This joins the current  line  with  the  line  immediately  below  it.  Any
   trailing whitespace and the original indentation whitespace are replaced by
   a single space.

2.5 Copy Paste and Related Functions
------------------------------------
  The mapping of functions to the mid  keypad  approximates  to  most  of  the
  key-cap functions but not, perhaps, the meaning IBM originally intended.
    - Delete and Insert become Cut and Paste respectively,
    - End is the Note key and
    - Page Up/Down work as advertised.
    
  Users lacking the mid keypad need not despair, for the benefit of  them  and
  their tiny laptops, the cut and  paste  operations  are  also  available  on
  function keys. Users lacking a mid keypad need not despair,  most  of  these
  functions are also available as escape sequences.
  
2.5.1 Note
----------
> {Ctrl+Shift+F1}
  or
> {Home}
  or
> {Esc n o}
  
  The current character position is noted for a later cut or copy operation.
  
2.5.2 Cut
---------
> {Ctrl+Alt+F2}
  or
> {Delete}
  or
> {Esc c u}
  
  Text from the last-defined note point up to the current  character  position
  is moved the paste buffer - this the the _ buffer in jot.
  
2.5.3 Copy
----------
> {Ctrl+Shift+F3}
  or
> {End}
  or
> {Esc c o}
  
  Text from the last-defined note point up to the current  character  position
  is copied to the paste buffer. This  operation  is  permitted  for  Readonly
  buffers - see `%b=readonly` where the `Cut` operation is guaranteed to fail.
    
2.5.4 Paste
-----------
> {Ctrl+Shift+F4}
  or
> {Insert}
  or
> {Esc p t}
  
  The contents of the paste buffer is inserted into the text  at  the  current
  character position.
   
2.5.5 CumulativeCopy
--------------------
> {Shift+Alt+F3}
  or
> {Shift+End}
  
  Text from the last-defined note point up to the current  character  position
  is appended to the end of the paste buffer. This operation is permitted  for
  Readonly buffers (see `%b=readonly`). If no note point  was  set,  then  the
  complete line is copied to the paste buffer.
  
2.5.6 CutTabular
----------------
> {Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F2}
  or
> {Ctrl+Delete}
  
  CutTabular removes the selected text to the paste buffer  but  the  text  is
  replaced by blanks.  The  intention  is  to  preserve  the  structure  of  a
  whitespace-separated table.
  
2.5.7 CumulativeCut
-------------------
> {Shift+Alt+F2}
  or
> {Shift+Delete}
  
  The CumulativeCut function removes the selected text, appending  it  to  the
  end of the paste buffer.
  
2.5.8 CutRectangle
------------------
> {Shift+Alt+F2}
  or
> {Alt+Delete}
  or
> {Esc r c}
  
  First go to the top left corner of the rectangle and note the position  with
  `Note`, then move the cursor to the bottom-right corner of the rectangle and
  apply `CutRectangle`. The text is removed and replaced by blanks leaving the
  current character at the original note point (the top-left corner of the cut
  text).
  
  To restore  the  text  at  it's  original  position  apply  `PasteRectangle`
  immediately after CutRectangle.
  
2.5.9 PasteRectangle
--------------------
> {Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F4}
  or
> {Alt+Insert}
  or
> {Esc r p}
  
  The paste buffer is assumed to contain some graphical or tabular text  (i.e.
  some lines of text where both  the  horizontal  and  vertical  placement  of
  characters is significant). The picture is inserted at the current character
  position and in the same column of succeeding lines, text to  the  right  of
  the inserted  block  retains  it's  original  position.  The  `CutRectangle`
  function can be used to extract the block of text.
  
2.5.10 rotateDiagonal
---------------------
> {Esc r d}
  
  This rotates all characters around the leading diagonal - this function  may
  be of use for some types of block diagrams. 
  
2.5.11 rotateHorizontal
-----------------------
> {Esc r h}
  
  This rotates whole lines of text around the central horizontal axis so  that
  the order of the lines is reversed - this function may be of  use  for  some
  types of block diagrams.
  
2.5.12 rotateVertical
---------------------
> {Esc r v}  
  
  This rotates all the text columns around the central vertical axis  so  that
  the order of the columns is reversed, adding extra whitespace when necessary
  - this function may be of use for some types of block diagrams. 

2.6 Do Functions
----------------
  This group of functions is about running jot command files. 
  
2.6.1 Do
--------
> [<pathName>]{F2}
  
  Run a command file. The default path is your current working  directory,  if
  the  named  file  does  not  exist  there  then  it  searches  for   it   in
  ${JOT_HOME}/coms, the default file extension is .jot
     
2.6.2 ScriptByName
------------------
> [<string>]{Shift+F2}
  
  Searches all scripts in ${JOT_HOME}/coms and your pwd for those  with  names
  matching the string. If no string given then lists  all  scripts  with  .jot
  name extension.
  
2.6.3 ScriptByFunc
------------------
> [<string>]{Ctrl+F2}

  pwd for those with functions matching the string. If no  string  given  then
  lists all scripts with .jot name extension and their first lines.

2.7 Matching Functions
----------------------
  The simplest of these are simply to navigate to the  start  or  end  of  the
  current paragraph  or  code  section.  Others  are  about  finding  matching

2.7.5 BlockUp
-------------
> {Esc - m b}
  
  In this context, a block of text is  any  number  of  lines  bounded  by  an
  completely blank line or one of  the  ends  of  the  buffer.  This  function
  searches back up the text for the previous blank line and leaves the  cursor
  at the start of the next non-blank line.
  
  See `about  words,  lines,  phrases,  sentences,  paragraphs,  sections  and
  chapters`.

  subcircuit  or  whatever,  introduced  by  a   declaration   containing   an
  alpha-numeric character in column 0.
  
  See `about  words,  lines,  phrases,  sentences,  paragraphs,  sections  and
  chapters`.
     
2.7.10 SectionDown

  to begin with an upper-case alpha character which must follow  either  ASCII
  full stop ( . ) or a  blank  line  separated  by  at  least  one  whitespace
  character.
  
  See `about  words,  lines,  phrases,  sentences,  paragraphs,  sections  and
  chapters`.
     
2.7.13 IndentMatchUp
-------------------
> {Ctrl+Shift+F7}
  or
> {Esc - m i}
   
  Searches back up the text for the previous line at the same indent level  as
  the current line. Initially the cursor may  be  anywhere  in  the  line,  on
  completion it is left on the first non-blank character of the line.
   
2.7.14 IndentMatchDown
---------------------
> {Ctrl+Shift+F8}
  or
> {Esc m i}
   
  Searches forwards in the text for the next  line  at  the  same  indentation
  level as the current line. Initially the cursor may be anywhere in the line,
  on completion it is left on the first non-blank character of the line.
  
2.7.15 AnyMatch
--------------
> {Esc m a}
  
  This function matches some form of  brace  character  with  it's  mate,  the
  cursor must be positioned over a brace character.
  
  The cursor must initially be placed over one of the following characters: (,
  {, [, <, ), }, ] or >. The AnyMatch  function  then  calls  the  appropriate
  matching   function   (respectively   `ParenMatchLeft`,    `CurlyMatchLeft`,
  `SquareMatchLeft`, `AngleMatchLeft`,  `ParenMatchRight`,  `CurlyMatchRight`,
  `SquareMatchRight` or `AngleMatchRight`) to locate the matching character in
  the text. On completion  the  cursor  is  placed  over  the  matching  brace
  character.
  
2.7.16 ParenMatchLeft
--------------------
> {Shift+Alt+F5}
> {Esc m ) }
   
  If the cursor is above a parenthesis close character ')', then the cursor is
  moved back (leftwards and upwards) to the  corresponding  parenthesis  open.
  This works by plodding through the text, counting open and  close  braces  (
  and ), until the corresponding parenthesis-open character is found.
  
  Between the initial ')' and it's matching  '(',  parenthesis  characters  in
  strings delimited by double quotes ( " ) are ignored as are  matching  pairs
  of parenthesis characters which may be nested to any depth.
  
  If the cursor is not above a parenthesis-close character, then the buffer is
  searched back to find the previous parenthesis close and the cursor moved to
  the corresponding parenthesis open.
  
2.7.17 ParenMatchRight
---------------------
> {Shift+Alt+F6}
> {Esc m ( }
   
  If cursor is above a parenthesis open '(' character, then  cursor  is  moved
  forwards (rightwards and downwards) to the corresponding  parenthesis  close
  ')'. This works by plodding through the text, counting open and close braces
  ( and ), until the corresponding parenthesis-close character is found.
  
  Between the initial '(' and it's matching  ')',  parenthesis  characters  in
  strings delimited by double quotes ( " ) are ignored as are  matching  pairs
  of parenthesis characters which may be nested to any depth.
  
  If the current character is not above a parenthesis-open character, then  it
  searches forwards for one and then finds the corresponding parenthesis close
  character.
   
2.7.18 CurlyMatchLeft
--------------------
> {Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F5}
> {Esc m } }
   
  Similar to <<ParenMatchLeft>>, above, except matches { and }.
  
  Note, if intending to traverse C code, `c.jot` is preferable as this  script
  will ignore any curly brackets in C comments and strings.
   
2.7.19 CurlyMatchRight
----------------------
> {Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F6}
> {Esc m { }
   
  Similar to <<ParenMatchRight>>, above, except matches { and }.
  
  Note, if intending to traverse C code, `c.jot` is preferable as this  script
  will ignore any curly brackets in C comments and strings.
   
2.7.20 AngleMatchLeft
---------------------
> {Ctrl+Shift+F5}
> {Esc m < }
  
  Similar to <<ParenMatchLeft>>, above, except matches < and >.
     
2.7.21 AngleMatchRight
----------------------
> {Ctrl+Shift+F6}
> {Esc m > }
  
  Similar to <<ParenMatchRight>>, above, except matches < and >.
   
2.7.22 SquareMatchLeft
----------------------
> {Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F7}
> {Esc m [ }
  
  Similar to <<ParenMatchLeft>>, above, except matches [ and ].
   
2.7.23 SquareMatchRight
----------------------
> {Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F8}
> {Esc m ] }
  
  Similar to <<ParenMatchRight>>, above, except matches [ and ].
   
2.7.24 MarkupMatchLeft
----------------------
> {Esc - m m }
  
  This is for use with HTML and XML.  MarkupMatchLeft,  works  back  from  the
  current cursor position,  it  first  locates  the  previous  "</"  string  -
  indicating the end of a block  in  HTML  and  XML.  It  then  picks  up  the
  block-type tag and finds the corresponding block-start.
   
2.7.25 MarkupMatchRight
-----------------------
> {Esc m m }
  
  This is for use with HTML and XML. MarkupMatchRight works forwards from  the
  current  cursor  position,  it  first  locates  the  next  "<"  character  -
  indicating a block start in HTML and XML. It then picks  up  the  block-type
  tag and finds the corresponding block-end.

2.8 The Cursor-control keys
---------------------------
  In addition to navigating around the text,  there  are  also  functions  for
  adjusting the view.
  
2.8.1 Up
---------
> [<n>]{UpArrow}
  
  Move up by n lines (defaults to 1) - the current line  becomes  the  line  n
  lines above original current  line,  the  current  character  is  the  first
  character of the new line.
    
2.8.2 WordUp
------------
> {Shift+UpArrow}
  
  The behaviour for tabular and  non-tabular  documents  is  different  -  see
  `about tabular text` for details. Essentially, for non-tabular text,  WordUp
  moves the cursor up in a column, for tabular text  WordUp  moves  p  in  the
  current table column.
  
  For non-tabular text the the  column  is  defined  by  the  `NewWordUp`  and
  `NewWordDown` functions using the Y0 flavour of the `Y` command. This  locks
  the WordUp/Down functions into to a particular column.
  
  For tabular text,  WordUp/Down  ignores  the  Y-command  column  and  simply
  navigates up or down from the current cell in the table.
   
2.8.3 NewWordUp
--------------
> {Ctrl+UpArrow}
  
  Sets the column for the `WordUp` function, subsequent invocations of  WordUp
  will attempt to stay in the same column as the current character -  see  the
  `Y` command.
  
2.8.4 Home
----------
  Not currently assigned to any key.
  
  The current line is set to the first line in the file, the current character
  is the first character of the line.
  
2.8.5 ViewUp
------------
> [<n>]{Ctrl+Shift+UpArrow}
  
  Shifts the view up by n lines (defaults to 1) without changing  the  current
  line, character or selected substring.
  
2.8.6 Down
----------
> [<n>]{DownArrow}
  
  Move down by n (defaults to 1) lines - the current line pointer  is  shifted
  down, the current character becomes the first character of the new line.
    
2.8.7 WordDown
--------------
> {Shift+DownArrow}
  
  Similar to `WordUp` except that it moves the cursor down the screen.
  
2.8.8 NewWordDown
-----------------
> {Ctrl+DownArrow}
  
  Sets the column for  the  `WordDown`  function,  subsequent  invocations  of
  WordDown will attempt to stay in the same column as the current character  -
  see the `Y` command.
  
2.8.9 End
----------
  Not currently assigned to any key.
  
  The view is change to the last page in the file, the  current  line  is  the
  last line of the buffer, the current character becomes the  first  character
  of this line.
    
2.8.10 ViewDown
---------------
> [<n>]{Ctrl+Shift+DownArrow}
  
  Shifts the view down by n lines (defaults to 1) without changing the current
  line, character or selected substring.
    
2.8.11 Left
-----------
> [<n>]{LeftArrow}
  or
> [<n>]{Ctrl+KP_4}
  or
> {Esc m w}
  
  Move the cursor n (defaults to 1) characters left of it's original position.
  
  The same function is attached to {Ctrl+KP_4} and {Esc m w}  for  consistency
  and for the benefit of those navigating a line drawing. It's easier to  hold
  the Ctrl key down while using the other line-drawing navigation functions on
  {Ctrl+KP_2}, {Ctrl+KP_8} and {Ctrl+KP_6}
  
2.8.12 WordLeft
---------------
> [<n>]{Shift+LeftArrow}
  
  For tabular text, i.e. the current line contains Tab characters, this  moves
  the cursor to the cell left of the current cell and, if  necessary,  adjusts
  leftoffset to bring all of the cell into view.
   
  For non-tabular text, this moves the cursor to the start of  previous  word.
  If the cursor is not currently above a word the cursor moves to the start of
  the current word.
   
  If n is given the process is repeated that many times.
   
2.8.13 LineLeft
---------------
> {Ctrl+LeftArrow})
  
  Moves to the start of the current line, if already  at  the  start  of  line
  moves to the start of the previous line.
  
2.8.14 Right
------------
> [<n>]{RightArrow}
  
  Move the cursor  n  (defaults  to  1)  characters  right  of  it's  original
  position.
   
2.8.15 WordRight
----------------
> [<n>]{Shift+RightArrow}
  
  For tabular text, i.e. the current line contains Tab characters, this  moves
  the cursor to the cell right of the current cell and, if necessary,  adjusts
  leftoffset to bring all of the cell into view.
   
  For non-tabular text, this moves the cursor to the start of  next  word.  If
  the cursor is not currently above a word the cursor moves to  the  start  of
  the current word.
   
  If n is given the process is repeated that many times.
   
2.8.16 LineRight
----------------
> [<n>]{Ctrl+RightArrow}
  
  Moves to the end of the current line, if already at the end  of  a  line  it
  move to the end of the next line.
  
2.8.17 PageUp
-------------
> [<n>]{PageUp}
  or
> [<n>]{Page Up}
  
  The view changed to show the page above  the  previously-displayed  page  of
  text, the current-line is changed according to the current window  size  and
  the character pointer is set to the first character of the new line.
  
2.8.18 PageDown
---------------
> [<n>]{Page Down}
  
  The view is changed to the page below the current page.
    
2.8.19 GotoFoldStart
--------------------
  Not currently assigned to any key.
  
  Find matching fold-start. In a file with fold marks, when  at  a  fold  end,
  this will search back for the corresponding fold start.
  
2.8.20 GotoFoldEnd
------------------
  Not currently assigned to any key.
  
  Find matching fold end. In a file with { { { and } } } fold marks, when at a
  fold start, this will search for the corresponding fold end.

2.9 Macros 0 to 9
-----------------                    
  For users lacking a numeric keypad, typically those with small laptops,  the
  basic functions 0-9 are  obtained  using  Escape  then  a  numeric  key  the
  appropriate numeric key - e.g. for Macro 8 - hit the escape key followed  by
  the 8 key - denoted by {Esc 8}. Alternatively, many linux distributions seem
  to map {Alt+F<n>} as {Esc F<n>}.
   
  In windows, each key on the numeric keypad is uniquely identifiable by  it's
  keycode. In linux/curses the keys map  to  identical  codes  to  the  normal
  numeric keys or to those on the mid keypad according to the state of NumLock
  see `X-windows setup`).

2.10 Line-drawing Functions
--------------------------
  The following line-drawing functions are provided. Many are  driven  by  the
  numeric keypad, unix users will have  to  set  these  up  -  see  `X-windows
  setup`. 
  
  See `about block graphics` and `graphical text - 1` ...
  
2.11 LineDefaultChrs
--------------------
> <key>{Esc l d}
  Where the key is one of the following:
    - <blank> --  restores  the  default  line-drawing  character  set  (ASCII
      hyphens and vertical bars).
    - l -- (light) horizontals and verticals use unicode ( │ and  ─  ),  along
      with appropriate corners and intersection characters.
    - h -- (heavy) horizontals and verticals use unicode ( ┃ and  ━  ),  along
      with appropriate corners and intersection characters.
    - d -- (double) horizontals and verticals use unicode ( ║ and ═  ),  along
      with appropriate corners and intersection characters.
  
2.10.1 UpRegardless
-------------------
> {Ctrl+KP_8}
  
  This is intended for line-drawings. When editing these it is essential that,
  as the cursor moves up or down, it remains  in  the  same  column.  This  is
  achieve by adding extra whitespace to the end of lines too short to maintain
  the cursor position.
  
  Also, if the original line was the first line in the  buffer,  a  new  blank
  line is inserted and populated with whitespace.
  
2.10.2 DownRegardless
---------------------
> {Ctrl+KP_2}
  
  This is intended for navigating around line-drawings. When editing these  it
  is essential that, as the cursor moves up or down, it remains  in  the  same
  column. This is achieve by adding extra whitespace to the end of  lines  too
  short to maintain the cursor position.
  
  Also, if the original line was the last line in the buffer, a new blank line
  is inserted and populated with whitespace.
  
2.10.3 RightRegardless
----------------------
> [<n>]{Ctrl+KP_6}
  
  Moves the cursor one character to the right, if the cursor is already at the
  end of a line  then  inserts  one  blank.  This  behaviour  is  designed  to
  facilitate navigation around line drawings - see also <<`UpRegardless`>> and
  <<`DownRegardless`>>.
  
2.10.4 LineNW
-------------
> [<string>]{Ctrl+Alt+KP_7}
  or
> [<string>]{Esc \ u}
  
  A line-drawing function. Draws string, from the  current-character  position
  in a north-westerly direction. If <string> is unspecified,  draws  a  single
  backslash ( \ ).
  
  As with other drawing functions, <<LineNW>> always  creates  new  lines  and
  inserts padding whitespace where necessary but will fail when the cursor  is
  in column 1 (the first character of a line).
  
2.10.5 LineN
------------
> [<string>]{Ctrl+Alt+KP_8}
  or
> [<string>]{Esc l n}
  
  A line-drawing function. Draws string, from the  current-character  position
  in a northerly  direction.  If  <string>  is  unspecified,  draws  a  single
  vertical bar ( | ).
  
2.10.6 LineNE
-------------
> [<string>]{Ctrl+Alt+KP_9}
  or
> [<string>]{Esc / u}
  
  A line-drawing function. Draws string, from the  current-character  position
  in a north-easterly direction. If <string> is unspecified,  draws  a  single
  slash ( / ).
  
2.10.7 LineE
------------
> [<string>]{Ctrl+Alt+KP_4}
  or
> [<string>]{Esc l e}
  
  A line-drawing function. Draws string, from the  current-character  position
  in a easterly direction. If <string> is unspecified, draws a single hyphen (
  - ).
  
2.10.8 LineW
------------
> [<string>]{Ctrl+Alt+KP_6}
  or
> [<string>]{Esc l w}
  
  A line-drawing function. Draws string, from the  current-character  position
  in a westerly direction. If <string> is unspecified, draws a single hyphen (
  - ).
  
2.10.9 LineSW
-------------
> [<string>]{Ctrl+Alt+KP_1}
  or
> [<string>]{Esc / d}
  
  A line-drawing function. Draws string, from the  current-character  position
  in a south-easterly direction. If <string> is unspecified,  draws  a  single
  slash ( / ).
  
  As with other drawing functions, <<LineSW>> always  creates  new  lines  and
  inserts padding whitespace where necessary but will fail when the cursor  is
  in column 1 (the first character of a line).
  
2.10.10 LineS
-------------
> [<string>]{Ctrl+Alt+KP_2}
  or
> [<string>]{Esc l s}
  
  A line-drawing function. Draws string, from the  current-character  position
  in a southerly  direction.  If  <string>  is  unspecified,  draws  a  single
  backslash ( \ ).
  
2.10.11 LineSE
--------------
> [<string>]{Ctrl+Alt+KP_3}
  or
> [<string>]{Esc \ d}
  
  A line-drawing function. Draws string, from the  current-character  position
  in a south-easterly direction. If <string> is unspecified,  draws  a  single
  backslash ( \ ).
  
2.10.12 DSLineNW
----------------
> [<string>]{Esc \ n}
  
  A line-drawing function similar to  LineNE  except  that  it  inserts  extra
  whitespace to draw at something like 45deg - the  actual  angle  depends  on
  your font size.
  
2.10.13 DSLineSE
----------------
> [<string>]{Esc \ s}
  
  A line-drawing function similar to  LineSE  except  that  it  inserts  extra
  whitespace to draw at something like 45deg - the  actual  angle  depends  on
  your font size.
  
2.10.14 DSLineSW
---------------
> [<string>]{Esc / s}
  
  A line-drawing function similar to  LineSE  except  that  it  inserts  extra
  whitespace to draw at something like 45deg - the  actual  angle  depends  on
  your font size.
  
2.10.15 DSLineNE
----------------
> [<string>]{Esc / n}
  
  A line-drawing function similar to  LineNE  except  that  it  inserts  extra
  whitespace to draw at something like 45deg - the  actual  angle  depends  on
  your font size.
  
2.10.16 Box
-----------
> [<width> <height>]{Esc b x}
  
  This draws a box, using hyphens ( - ) and vertical bars  (  |  ),  with  the
  top-left corner of the box at the current cursor position. If the dimensions
  are not specified, the box size defaults to 10 characters wide  by  5  lines
  high.
  
2.10.17 Lozenge
---------------
> [<size>]{Esc z 1}
  
  This draws a lozenge shape using slashes ( / ) and backslashes (  \  ).  The
  size is the number of slashes down any side, and defaults to 5.
  
2.10.18 DSLozenge
-----------------
> [<size>]{Esc z2}
  Similar to the `Lozenge` function except that it uses double-spacing.
  
2.10.19 BoxText
---------------
> <string>{Esc b t}
  
  This inserts text into an area bounded my line drawn with  Hyphens  (  -  ),
  Vertical bars ( | ), or slashes ( / and \ ). It is intended to simplify  the
  process of labelling boxes where the label requires more than  one  line  in
  the box.

2.11 Housekeeping Functions
---------------------------
2.11.1 Again
------------
> [<n>]{F10}
  
  Repeats last command or hotkey once by default or n times if n is  specified
  if n is zero then the command is repeated to exhaustion.
  
2.11.2 AgainExhaustive
----------------------
> {Shift+F10}
  
  Repeats the last-given command until it fails and  then  reports  the  total
  number of iterations (including the original). Typically this might be  used
  to determine how many instances of a string exist in the buffer.
  
  It's left to the user to add one to the result provided (it's  already  done
  one, remember).
  
  It's also left to the user to  not  attempt  to  use  this  on  commands  or
  functions that never fail. `Insert`, for example,  will  keep  on  inserting
  until something breaks - possibly the editor running out of memory and  that
  might take some time.

2.11.3 InsertMode
----------------
> {Esc I n}
  
  Enters insert mode, this mode persists until {Ctrl+c} or next {Esc I n}. See
  `Insert mode` and `Command-mode vs. insert mode`
  
2.11.4 TempInsertMode
--------------------
> {Esc i n}
  Temporarily  enters   insert   mode,   this   mode   persists   until   next
  escape-sequence  or  function-key   operation.   See   `Insert   mode`   and
  `Command-mode vs. insert mode`
  
2.11.5 DebuggerQuit
------------------
> [<n>]{Esc q}
  
  If no value is entered  for  n,  it  exits  the  debugger  prompt  loop  and
  continues to the next explicit `T` command - see also `About jot debugging`.
  
  When n is specified, even if it is  given  the  value  0,  the  DebuggerQuit
  function suppresses normal tracing through to the end of the next  block  at
  the specified run level. The run level is calculated a relative to  the  run
  level when the DebuggerQuit function was called.  Each  macro,  function  or
  script increments the run level on entry and decrements  it  on  exit.  
  
  Thus  DebuggerQuit  effectively  steps-over  functions,  macros  etc.   when
  Trace_Break is set (see `%S=trace`).
  
  Of all the functions which take a parameter, DebuggerQuit is  the  only  one
  that does not prompt in  screen-edit  mode.  This  is  because  passing  the
  parameter in the ( $ ) buffer will corrupt whatever is in  that  buffer  for
  the code being debugged - and that can sometimes be catastrophic.
  
2.11.6 CmdEditStart
-------------------
> {Esc c e}
  
  Switches from your current view to a list of  recent  commands  followed  by
  whatever you might have been typing to the console. By default only the last
  20 commands are  saved  this  limit  can  be  changed  with  the  `-History`
  command-line qualifier. 
  
  Select one of these command lines for re-execution  by  placing  the  cursor
  anywhere in the line and invoking `CmdEditGo`. The line  can  be  edited  if
  necessary using normal editing functions - see `about command editing`.
   
2.11.7 CmdEditGo
----------------
> {Esc c g}
  
  Returns from the command-edit screen (see `CmdEditStart`) to  your  original
  context and leaves the selected command string in the console - (see  `about
  command editing`).
  
2.11.8 CmdString
----------------
> <JotCommandString>{Esc c s}
  
  This is only useful when the editor is being used in insert mode. It  offers
  a route for manually-entered commands. In insert mode the escape sequence is
  typed in first, then the command string is entered in response to a prompt -
  see `about command parameters`.
  
2.11.9 ViewLeft
---------------
> [<n>]{Ctrl+Shift+LeftArrow}
  
  Shifts the buffer view n columns leftwards, n defaults to 1.
   
2.11.10 ViewRight
----------------
> [<n>]{Ctrl+Shift+RightArrow}
  
  Shifts the buffer view n columns rightwards, n defaults to 1.
  
2.11.11 WindowOne
-----------------
> [n]{Esc w 1}
  
  Restores display to a simple window showing current  buffer,  clears  colour
  tags from current buffer and resets the left offset for the current buffer.
  
  The optional numeric argument is the desired console-area size (defaults  to
  1). The new window height is calculated so as to leave the specified  number
  of lines for the console area.
  
  The size of the window can be adjusted using the `WindowShrink` function, to
  increase the size of the console area  at  the  expense  of  the  window  or
  `WindowStretch` function, to increase the size of the window at the  expense
  of the console.
  
  See also `WindowHorizSplit` and `WindowVertSplit` functions.
  
2.11.12 WindowHorizSplit
------------------------
> {Esc w h}
  
  Horizontal split display to one more window than is currently on display.
  
  This function counts the total number of windows <n> currently displayed  on
  screen, irrespective of  their  current  configuration,  and  redefines  the
  windows as <n+1> horizontal strips, leaving a 1-line console area. The  size
  of a window can be adjusted using `WindowShrink` and `WindowStretch` -  note
  the optional window-selection argument to these functions.
  
  The new-window focus is initially set to the current buffer -  this  may  be
  displayed by some other window. Any focus-change operation (`Z`, `%I`,  `%Q`
  etc. ) will affect the bottom window on the display.
   
  See also `WindowOne` and `WindowVertSplit` functions.
  
2.11.13 WindowVertSplit
-----------------------
> {Esc w v}
  
  Vertical split of the display terminal into one more window slices  than  is
  currently on display.
  
  This function counts the total number of windows <n> currently displayed  on
  screen, irrespective of their current configuration, and creates slices  the
  whole screen into <n+1> vertical slices. The slice width  is  calculated  to
  give the correct number of equal-width slices. The width of the slice can be
  adjusted using the `WindowShrink` and `WindowStretch` functions -  note  the
  optional window-selection argument to these functions. The slice-heights are
  designed to give a 1-line console area.
  
  Window height is calculated so as to leave 4 lines for the console  display.
  To change the height of all slices in the slice group you must specify a new
  height for the first (leftmost) slice in the group - see  `%W`  -  typically
  this will be window 0, In this case, the command to change the height  would
  be:
> %w= -winno=0 -height=<newHeight>;
  
  See also `WindowOne` and `WindowHorizSplit` functions.
  
2.11.14 WindowAlignTop
----------------------
> [winNo]{Esc w t}
  
  Essentially, this adjusts view to bring the current line to the top  of  the
  viewing window. If you have a guardband set (see  `%s=guardband`)  then  the
  current line will not approach the top margin by fewer  than  the  specified
  number of lines.
   
  When there is only one window then that's all there is to it. When there are
  more windows, it's a bit more complicated.
    - If now winNo argument is given, then it adjusts all windows so that  the
      current line of the buffer appears at the top of the window. If, by  any
      chance, the same buffer appears in more than one window, then all  these
      windows will show the current line at the top of the window.
    - If a winNo is given, then the buffer that's currently being displayed in
      there is adjusted to align the current line of the buffer with  the  top
      line of the window.
      
      The window number is that displayed in the initial  window-list  section
      of the `query window` report. Windows are counted, from 0, from left  to
      right and then from top to bottom.
  
2.11.15 WindowAlignCent
-----------------------
> [winNo]{Esc w c}
  
  Essentially, this adjusts view to bring the current line to  the  centre  of
  the viewing window.
  
  When there is only one window then that's all there is to it. When there are
  more windows, it's a bit more complicated.
    - If now winNo argument is given, then it adjusts all windows so that  the
      current line of the buffer appears at the centre of the window.  If,  by
      any chance, the same buffer appears in more than one  window,  then  the
      first of these windows will show the current line at the centre  of  the
      window, the view in others will depend on the relative  heights  of  the
      windows showing that buffer.
    - If a winNo is given, then the buffer that's currently being displayed in
      there is adjusted to align the current  line  of  the  buffer  with  the
      centre line of the window.
      
      The window number is that displayed in the initial  window-list  section
      of the `query window` report. Windows are counted, from 0, from left  to
      right and then from top to bottom.
  
2.11.16 WindowAlignBot
----------------------
> [winNo]{Esc w b}
  
  Essentially, this adjusts view to bring the current line to  the  bottom  of
  the viewing window. If you have a guardband set  (see  `%s=guardband`)  then
  the current line will  not  approach  the  top  margin  by  fewer  than  the
  specified number of lines.
  
  When there is only one window then that's all there is to it. When there are
  more windows, it's a bit more complicated.
    - If now winNo argument is given, then it adjusts all windows so that  the
      current line of the buffer appears at the bottom of the window.  If,  by
      any chance, the same buffer appears in more than one  window,  then  the
      first of these windows will show the current line at the bottom  of  the
      window, the view in others will depend on the relative  heights  of  the
      windows showing that buffer.
    - If a winNo is given, then the buffer that's currently being displayed in
      there is adjusted to align the current  line  of  the  buffer  with  the
      bottom line of the window.
      
      The window number is that displayed in the initial  window-list  section
      of the `query window` report. Windows are counted, from 0, from left  to
      right and then from top to bottom.
  
2.11.17 WindowShrink
-------------------
> [<winno>]{Ctrl+Alt+UpArrow}
  or
> [<winno>]{Esc w -}
  
  Reduces the height of the specified [or current] window by 1  line.  If  the
  window ends up with a width of 0 or less, then the window is deleted.
   
  Normally there will be only one window, where there is more than one  window
  and no window number is specified  then  the  first  window  displaying  the
  current buffer is shrunk. Note that slices (vertically split screens) it  is
  the width of the specified slice that is adjusted.
  
  See also `WindowStretch` and `WindowOne`.
   
2.11.18 WindowStretch
--------------------
> [<winno>]{Ctrl+Alt+DownArrow}
  or
> [<winno>]{Esc w +}
  
  Increases the height of the specified [or current] window by 1 line.
   
  Normally there will be only one window, where there is more than one  window
  and no window number is specified  then  the  first  window  displaying  the
  current buffer is stretched. Note that slices (vertically split screens)  it
  is the width of the specified slice that is adjusted.
  
  See also `WindowShrink` and `WindowOne`.
  
2.11.19 WindowDown
------------------
> {Esc w d}
  
   Shifts focus to the next window - windows are  ordered  left-to-right  then
   top-to-bottom as they appear on the screen. If the current focus is already
   in the last (rightmost, bottommost) window, then focus is switched  to  the
   first (topmost and leftmost) window.
  
2.11.20 WindowUp
----------------
> {Esc w u}
  
  Essentially the same as `WindowDown`, above, except that  it  moves  through
  the windows from right-to-left and from bottom-to-top.

2.11.21 WindowSave
------------------
> [<configName>]{Esc w s}
  
  WindowSave will make a record of the current window configuration  (actually
  in the form of a `query window` report) and save it in a data object buffer.
  The optional ConfigName is used to define the data-object name - the default
  name is "default". It then calls `WindowOne` to give a  basic  single-window
  view.
  
  If the given configuration name has  already  been  defined,  then  the  old
  window configuration is silently destroyed and replaced by the new one.
  
  This function is designed to be used with `WindowRestore` which can be  used
  to restore the original window configuration.

2.11.22 WindowRestore
---------------------
> [<configName>]{Esc w r}
  
  WindowRestore will restore  a  previously-saved  window  configuration  (see
  `WindowSave`). If  the  named  window  configuration  does  not  exist,  the
  function fails without making any changes to the window configuration. 
  
  As with WindowSave, the default window-configuration name "default".

2.11.23 WindowReassign
----------------------
> <windowNo>[ <bufferKey>]{Esc w a}
  
  Changes the buffer binding for the specified window.  If  a  buffer  key  is
  given then the window is bound to that buffer otherwise, the window  is  set
  to be floating - it displays whatever happens to be the current buffer.
  
2.11.24 ViewSave
----------------
> [<viewName>]{Esc v s}  
  
  This function  sets  up  a  jump  object  and  a  data  object  (see  `about
  hashtables`)  named  ViewJump_<viewName>  and  ViewJump_FirstLine_<viewName>
  respectively in the code repository hashtable. Where <viewName> is the given
  viewname - this name, rather imaginatively, defaults to "default". The  view
  can then be restored using the `ViewRestore` function.
  
  Note that ViewSave and the `ViewRestore` function will not always  work  for
  floating buffers (i.e. buffers on the stack) - the correct buffer has to  be
  at the top of the stack for ViewRestore to work correctly.
  
  In the event of a non-unique viewname, the new view  silently  replaces  the
  original view.
  
  Many different views can be held by assigning each a unique name, the actual
  limit is set by the total capacity  of  the  code-repository-buffer  (  '  )
  hashtable, normally set to 1000,  of  which  about  200  are  used  for  the
  function names. View names may be of any length.
  
2.11.25 ViewRestore
-------------------
> [<viewName>]{Esc v r}  
  
  This function  restores  a  previously-saved  view  answering  to  the  name
  <viewName>, as with `ViewSave` the default view name is "default".
  
2.11.26 AddNewFunctions
-----------------------
> %h'=call AddNewFunctions;
  
  This function is used by jot scripts  to  add  new  functions  to  the  code
  repository. It assumes that the new functions have been  defined  in  the  @
  buffer, it appends the contents of @ to the code repository  and  makes  the
  correct hash-table entries.
  
  For an example of usage look at ${JOT_HOME}/coms/get.jot.

2.12 Mouse-Event Bindings
-------------------------
  In Linux, where X-windows  provides  useful  mouse  functions,  mouse-button
  events are all ignored by jot allowing them to be picked up by X-windows. In
  Windows, which has virtually no  useful  mouse  actions,  all  normal  mouse
  events are picked up by jot. This behaviour is defined in the startup script
  (see `startup.jot`) and can be changed by adopting a custom startup script.
  
2.12.1 NoteFromMouse
-------------------
> {Button2Down} ({Button1Down} in windows).
  
  This picks up and notes the the coordinates of the button-press and  sets  a
  note point there.
  
2.12.2 CopyFromMouse
-------------------
> {Button2Up} ({Button1Up} in windows).
  
  The note point is assumed to have been set by  the  Button-down  event  (see
  `NoteFromMouse`).This  picks  up  and   notes   the   coordinates   of   the
  button-release and abstracts from the current note  point  to  the  position
  indicated by the mouse at Button-Up time.
  
2.12.3 FocusToMouse
------------------
> {Button2DoubleClick}
  
  This picks up and notes the coordinates of the  button-press  and  sets  the
  editor focus point to the position indicated.
  
2.12.4 InsertHereMouse
---------------------
> {Button3Click}
  
  This picks up and notes the the coordinates of the button-press and  inserts
  the contents of the _ buffer there.

2.13 Mouse-Event Bindings - Windows
-----------------------------------
  One of the many crosses born by windows users is the lack  of  useful  mouse
  actions. Especially selections and most particularly  in  windows  consoles.
  The functions described below are not anything like as useful  as  X-windows
  selections but there we are ... any port in a storm.
  
2.13.1 SelectionStart
---------------------
> {Button1Down}
  
  The mouse cursor position is noted - the real  action  takes  place  as  the
  button is released.
  
2.13.2 SelectionEnd
-------------------
> {Button1Up}
  
  The new mouse cursor position is noted and, if it is on the same line as for
  the {Button1Down} event the text between the  two  points  is  copied  to  a
  selection buffer without affecting the editors cursor.
  
2.13.3 SelectionFree
--------------------
> {Button1Click}
  
  Any text in the selection buffer is deleted.
  
2.13.4 SelectionWord
--------------------
> {Button1DoubleClick}
  
  The mouse-cursor position is noted and, if it corresponds to a word  in  the
  text, then that word is copied to the selection buffer. In  this  context  a
  word is deemed to be any string consisting  of  alphanumeric  characters  or
  underscores.
  
2.13.5 SelectionLine
--------------------
- Not curreutly mapped to any button event.
  
  Similar to SelectionWord except that it selects the entire line.
  
2.13.6 SelectionPut
-------------------
> {Button2Click}
  
  The position of  the  mouse  cursor  is  irrelevant,  the  contents  of  the
  selection buffer is dumped into the command line.

2.14 The popup-menu functions
-----------------------------
  The startup script  defines  `PopupSearch`  and  `PopupIncrementalSearch`  -
  functions that search and list matching words in the popup menu.  The  popup
  can be driven by other functions  and  scripts  (eg  `SpellcheckDocument`  -
  which uses it to pass spelling corrections suggested by  Aspell).  See  also
  `Using the popup menu` for a quick tutorial on the popup.
  
  Clicking on a  popup-menu  item  launches  "PopupMouseSelect"  -  the  popup
  callback function which pushes the selected item back into the console  area
  where it can be used as a parameter to any jot function that takes a  string
  argument. It also clears the popup from the screen to get it back again call
  PopupRestore.
  
  The two search functions  "PopupSearch"  and  "PopupIncrementalSearch"  both
  search the current buffer in different ways and report their results in  the
  form of a popup menu. various functions  defined  by  the  `NextMisspelling`
  script also handle popup menus.
    
  In the event of the popup menu being  longer  than  the  popup  window,  two
  popup-scrolling functions are provided `PopupPageUp` and `PopupPageDown`.
  
2.14.1 PopupRestore
-------------------
> {Esc p r}
  
  This  restores  the  popup  menu  following   a   mouse-click   event   (see
  `PopupMouseSelect`) or can be called directly by some script that has set up
  something to be displayed as a popup menu.
  
  A new popup menu must be predefined in the ( - ) buffer, in the  form  of  a
  list of menu items  with  each  item  on  a  new  line.  Items  may  contain
  whitespace but any leading or trailing whitespace is removed before display.
  
  If no new popup is defined ( the ( - ) buffer is empty) then  the  last-used
  menu is used, this is held in the data object "'=PopupMenu".
  
  The  PopupRestore  function  is  called  by   `PopupSearch`   and   by   the
  `NextMisspelling` and `NextSpellInstance`, which offers  suggested  spelling
  corrections via the popup menu.
  
2.14.2 PopupSearch
------------------
> <substring>{Esc p s}
  
  This searches the current  buffer  for  words  matching  the  given  string.
  Matching words (any string consisting of ASCII alphanumeric  characters  and
  underscores) are displayed in the popup menu and may be selected by a  click
  of the left mouse button (see `PopupMouseSelect`).
  
2.14.3 PopupIncrementalSearch
-----------------------------
> [<initialSearchString>]{Esc p i}
  
  This performs an incremental search -  incremental  in  the  sense  that  it
  prompts and picks up your characters one at a time. As each new character is
  entered the document is searched for  instances  of  revised  search  string
  updating the list of matching words in the popup as the search string grows.
  Characters may be removed with the backspace key. The recommended method  of
  exiting the search loop is to hit {Return}. A {Ctrl+c} interrupt  will  also
  exit the function but this will leave the stack in an untidy state - you may
  have to clear the stack with the `O@` command - see `using the  popup  menu`
  for a walkthrough example.
  
  Note that, although the popup menu is visible while the  interactive  search
  is progressing, mouse events are disabled and are only re-enabled on exit. 
  
  When the optional initialSearchString arg is  given,  this  sets  the  start
  point for the search string. This is useful  when  searching  a  very  large
  document since it avoids the initial short search strings that can  generate
  a great many matches - this can make the function very slow and unresponsive
  as it filters and processes  the  results  of  these  initial  short  search
  strings.
  
  Each time a new character is entered it is appended to the search string and
  the whole file is scanned for words containing the  revised  search  string.
  The list of matching words is displayed in the  popup.  If  there  are  more
  matches  than  the  popup  has  capacity  to  display  them,  Then  use  the
  `PopupPageUp`  and  `PopupPageUp`  functions  to  navigate  in   the   popup
  menu - see `the popup-menu functions`.  PopupIncrementalSearch  reports  the
  number of matching words in it's prompt string.
  
  As usual, with jot popups, clicking on a popup line feeds that word into the
  console, where it can be used as an argument to any jot function that  takes
  a text-string argument.
  
2.14.4 PopupMouseSelect
-----------------------
