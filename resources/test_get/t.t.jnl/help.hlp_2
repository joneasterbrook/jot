Main help menu

  To select a help category use the cursor-up/down buttons.
  To get help hit the help button (this also reads in file folds).
  To go back up the help hierarchy select exit (or any non-foldmark line).
  
  N.B. On IBM keyboards the help key is F1, on Tek it's usually 'print screen'.
